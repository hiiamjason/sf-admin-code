{"text":"\n     (A)     In addition to the general findings set forth in Sections \n12D.2, \n12D.2-1, \n12D.2-2, \n12D.2-3, \n12D.2-4, \n12D.2-5 and \n12D.2-6 and based upon the record before this Board, the Board hereby makes these additional findings in support of the race- and gender-conscious bid preferences for purchasing contracts: \n          1.     In Ordinance No. 139-84 this Board identified discriminatory procurement practices in the award of purchasing contracts.\n          2.     The evidence before this Board relating to the award of contracts for fiscal year 1987-1988 reflects that MBEs (each ethnic group listed as a minority) and WBEs continue to be awarded contract dollars in certain categories of purchasing contracts in dollar amounts that are disproportionately lower than the available number of MBEs and WBEs in the private sector. These results cannot be attributed to chance. In light of the testimony before this Board and the Commission in 1983, 1984, 1988 and 1989, this Board finds that these results can only be attributed to discriminatory procurement practices. \n          3.     The evidence before this Board supports the conclusion that MBEs and WBEs continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices when competing for the aforementioned purchasing contracts. \n          4.     Race-neutral measures employed by the City in the past for those purchasing contracts subject to the \"lowest, reliable, responsible bidder\" standard did not prevent the discriminatory practices from occurring. \n          5.     The Board is granting a competitive advantage, the bid preference, to MBEs and WBEs to offset the identified competitive disadvantage caused by the City's discriminatory procurement practices. \n          6.     The evidence before this Board relating to the award of purchasing contracts for fiscal years 1989-1990 and 1990-1991 reflects that certain minority groups have improved their participation in City purchasing contracts. However, based on the testimony and other evidence before this Board, the Board concludes that remedial action continues to be necessary to enable these groups to overcome past discrimination in the award of purchasing contracts. The Director shall closely monitor the participation of these groups in purchasing contracts and report the results of such monitoring to the Board pursuant to Section \n12D.6(B)(2). \n     (B)     Equipment and supplies contracts or general services contracts as defined herein awarded by the purchaser shall be subject to the race- and gender-conscious bid preferences of this ordinance. \n     (C)     In addition to the duties given the purchaser elsewhere, the purchaser shall maintain, with the assistance of the Director, a current list of Minority and Woman Business Enterprises certified by the Commission to provide each of those commodities or services subject to this ordinance which the purchaser indicates are required by the City. The purchaser shall notify the Director prior to solicitation of bids or quotations whenever no such certified businesses are available for a contract subject to the race- and gender-conscious bid preferences of this ordinance, unless the Director waives such notification based on the known unavailability of such qualified businesses to perform a particular contract. The Director shall attempt to identify qualified businesses, and if successful, shall notify the purchaser of their availability; the purchaser shall provide such MBEs and WBEs every practical opportunity to submit bids or quotations. \n     (D)     The purchaser shall also maintain a central office where all bids, requests for proposals and solicitations will be listed and kept current. \n(Added by Ord. 175-89, App. 5/30/89; amended by Ord. 155-92, 5/29/92; Ord. 210-97, App. 5/30/97; Ord. 457-97, App. 12/15/97; Ord. 82-98, App. 3/6/98; Ord. 186-98, App. 6/5/98; Ord. 256-98, App. 7/31/98) \n\n","heading":{"title":"12D","chaptersection":"10. ","identifier":"12D.10. ","catch_text":"ADDITIONAL FINDINGS SUPPORTING RACE- AND GENDER-CONSCIOUS BID PREFERENCESCONTRACTS."}}
