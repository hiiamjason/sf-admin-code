The projects and programs included in the Expenditure Plan are designed to be implemented over the next 30 years. Provisions are also made for future updates to the New Expenditure Plan beyond the initial 30-year period. The New Expenditure Plan includes investments in four major categories: Transit, Streets and Roads (including street resurfacing, and bicycle and pedestrian improvements), Paratransit services for seniors and disabled people, and Transportation System Management/Strategic Initiatives, to fund neighborhood parking management, land use coordination, and beautification efforts. \n     The major capital projects to be funded by the New Expenditure Plan are: \n     Development of the Bus Rapid Transit/ MUNI Metro Network; \n     Construction of the MUNI Central Subway (3rd St. LRT Phase 2); \n     Construction of the Caltrain Downtown Extension to a Rebuilt Transbay Terminal; \n     Replacement of the South Access to the Golden Gate Bridge (Doyle Drive). \n     CONTEXT \n     The New Expenditure Plan for the use of Prop K funds was developed by the Expenditure Plan Advisory Committee (EPAC), appointed by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (Authority) Board, with technical assistance provided by the Authority and other transportation agencies. The roster of EPAC members is provided in Attachment 1. The Expenditure Plan was recommended by the Authority Board on July 22, 2003. \n     By providing the required local match, Prop K is intended to leverage about $9.6 billion in federal, state, and other local funding for transportation projects in San Francisco. \n     The New Expenditure Plan is a list of transportation projects and programs that will be given priority for Prop K funding. As such the New Expenditure Plan shall be amended into the Capital Improvement Program of the Congestion Management Program, developed pursuant to section 65089 of the California Government Code. These projects and programs are intended to help implement the long-range vision for the development and improvement of San Francisco's transportation system, as articulated in the San Francisco Long Range Countywide Transportation Plan. \n     The Countywide Transportation Plan is the City's blueprint to guide the development of transportation funding priorities and policy. The major objectives of the Countywide Transportation Plan are to enhance mobility and accessibility throughout the city, improve safety for all transportation system users, support the city's economic development and the vitality of our neighborhoods, sustain environmental quality, and promote equity and efficiency in transportation investments. The Countywide Transportation Plan is a living document, updated on a regular basis to identify and address changing needs and regional trends, and align them with available funding. \n     GOALS \n     The purpose of the New Expenditure Plan is to implement the priorities of the Countywide Transportation Plan through investment in a set of projects and programs that include planning, maintenance and rehabilitation of, and improvements to the city's multi-modal transportation system. Goals of the plan include: \n     Maintain the city's transportation infrastructure in a state of good repair. \n     Support an efficient, accessible, and fully integrated public transportation system that connects San Francisco's neighborhoods and links San Francisco to the region. \n     Improve the speed, reliability, and ridership of transit in San Francisco and the region. \n     Maintain a safe, attractive, well designed street network that provides mobility and public open space for residents and visitors. \n     Enhance mobility for all San Franciscans, including seniors and people with disabilities. \n     Maintain and enhance the city's roadway network to facilitate the safe movement of people and goods, including transit. \n     Improve safety and amenities for pedestrians and bicyclists. \n     Coordinate transportation investments with existing and planned land uses, to enhance livability and mobility, reduce traffic, and increase housing opportunities. \n     Promote economic vitality citywide. \n     Protect and enhance the environment. \n     Improve coordination between transportation agencies and departments. \n     Develop clear, equitable, and cost-effective methods for prioritizing transportation investments. \n     Wisely use local funding to secure state, federal, and regional matching funds for transportation projects. \n     STRUCTURE \n     The New Expenditure Plan is organized into five sections. Section 1: Introduction provides background on the Plan's goals and development. Section 2: General Provisions provides further context on the Plan's policies and administration. Section 3: Plan Summary provides the Plan's investment detail by category. Section 4: Description of Projects and Programs contains detailed descriptions of the projects and programs (by category and subcategory), and the types of items that are eligible for funding under each of them. Section 5: Implementation Provisions describes the process for prioritizing and allocating funds following adoption of the Plan. Section 6: Allocation and Reallocation of Funds, deals with the procedures to be followed in allocating and reallocating funds to the different levels of priority. Section 7: Update Process, deals with the mechanisms for developing updates beyond the initial 30-year period. The Authority recommends that the following elements be included in the New Transportation Expenditure Plan for San Francisco. \n     2.     PROVISIONS \n     SALES TAX REVENUES \n     The New Expenditure Plan shall supersede the Proposition B Expenditure Plan, adopted in 1989, as of the operative date of the New Expenditure Plan, pursuant to Section 131105 of the California Public Utilities Code. The existing one-half percent local sales tax dedicated to transportation improvements (approved in November 1989 as Proposition B) shall be continued for the duration of the New Expenditure Plan. \n     Revenues are estimated under three scenarios over the 30-year period of the New Expenditure Plan. The conservative projection puts the total revenue level at $2.35 billion (2003 dollars). The medium growth projection forecasts $2.62 billion; and the optimistic projection is $2.82 billion. These scenarios reflect average growth rates that vary from 1.4% per year to 1.65% to 2.15%. All three rates are based on historical trends in sales tax receipts in San Francisco, and are consistent with the projections used by the City and County of San Francisco and by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. \n     RESTRICTION OF FUNDS \n     Sales tax revenues shall be spent on capital projects rather than to fund operations and maintenance of existing transportation services, unless otherwise explicitly specified in the Plan Description. In accordance with enabling legislation and adopted principles, sales tax revenues generated pursuant to this plan shall be subject to the following restrictions: \n     NO SUBSTITUTION \n     a.      Sales tax revenues shall be used to supplement and under no circumstance replace existing local revenues used for transportation purposes. \n     b.      Proceeds from the sale or liquidation of capital assets funded with sales tax revenues shall be returned to the Authority (in proportion to the contribution of sales tax revenues to the total original cost of the asset), for re-allocation to eligible expenses within the categories from which funds were expended for the original investment. \n     INCREMENTAL OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS \n     Funds for operations and maintenance shall be limited exclusively to incremental costs associated with the operation of new transportation services and/or facilities, as specified in this plan. Regional operators and other non-San Francisco sponsors shall not be eligible for incremental operations and maintenance funding. Incremental costs shall be defined as solely those operating and maintenance costs that would clearly not have otherwise been incurred absent the new service or facility. The intent shall under no circumstance be to provide an ongoing subsidy, but rather to allow for a limited level of transitional funding, to help the department responsible for the operation and maintenance of the new facility or service built or purchased with sales tax funds, to identify alternative funding sources for these purposes and gradually and fully absorb the facility's incremental operating and/or maintenance costs into its own operating budget. Incremental operating and maintenance costs shall be reimbursable from the sales tax according to the following schedule. \n     Linear Decrease \n     The funding eligibility level for incremental operating and maintenance costs shall decrease linearly from 100% on the first year of operation to 0% on year 10. \n     Grandfathered Projects \n     Projects currently receiving Prop B reimbursement for incremental operating and maintenance costs shall be eligible for reimbursement under the sales tax according to the same schedule as detailed in section 2.B.ii.a., above, starting with the amount shown in the 2003 Strategic Plan Update for Prop B for fiscal year 2003/04. \n     NO EXPENDITURES OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO \n     No sales tax funds shall be spent outside the limits of the City and County of San Francisco, except for cases that satisfy all of the following conditions, and subject to a possible need for amendment of state legislation: \n     Quantifiable Benefit \n     The project, service, or programmatic category is included in the Expenditure Plan, and planning or other studies, developed in order to enable its implementation, demonstrate that there will be a quantifiable benefit to the City and County's transportation program from the expenditure of funds beyond the City and County line. A quantifiable benefit is defined as a measurable increase in the cost effectiveness of a project or group of transportation projects and or services at least partially funded with sales tax funds, located along the corridor or in the immediate geographic area of the City and County where the project in question is proposed to occur. \n     Expenses Matched By Other Counties \n     The proposed expense is matched by funding from the county where the expenditure of sales tax funds is proposed to be made. \n     Should transportation projects or services contemplated in the plan require the participation of multiple counties for any phase of project planning or implementation, the Authority shall work cooperatively with the affected county or counties to ensure successful project implementation? \n     IV.     FUNDING CAPS FOR GRANDFATHERED PROJECTS \n     Projects grandfathered from the Prop B Expenditure Plan, shall be eligible to receive Prop K Priority 1 funds from the appropriate equivalent subcategories, not to exceed the unallocated amounts programmed in the 2003 Prop B Strategic Plan Update. This section does not apply to incremental operating and maintenance costs, which are addressed separately in section ii.b., above. \n     SUCCESSOR PROGRAM \n     Upon approval of the Ordinance by the voters, the New Expenditure Plan shall supersede and become the successor program to the Expenditure Plan enacted in 1989 by the passage of the Proposition B local sales tax for transportation. As such it will bear responsibility for any outstanding debt incurred by the Proposition B program, and all assets of the Proposition B program shall become Prop K program assets. \n     BONDING AUTHORITY \n     The Authority shall be authorized to issue, from time to time, limited tax bonds in a total outstanding aggregate amount not to exceed $1.88 billion, payable from the sales tax revenues generated pursuant to this plan. The Authority's bonding capacity shall be separate and distinct from that of the City and County of San Francisco. \n     ADMINISTRATION BY THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY \n     The San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which currently allocates, administers and oversees the expenditure of the existing Prop B sales tax for transportation, shall allocate, administer and oversee the expenditure of the Prop K sales tax funds. \n     SUPPORT OF ADJACENT COUNTIES \n     It is deemed unnecessary to seek the support of adjacent counties by requesting them to develop their own Transportation Expenditure Plans because: \n     San Mateo, Alameda and Contra Costa Counties have already adopted Transportation Expenditure Plans; and \n     Marin County is currently evaluating Transportation Expenditure Plans \n     ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW \n     Environmental reporting, review and approval procedures as provided for under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and/or the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), and other applicable laws shall be carried out as a prerequisite to the implementation of any project to be funded partially or entirely with sales tax funds. \n     3.     SUMMARY \n     Table 1 summarizes the half-cent sales tax revenue allocations by project category and subcategory in constant 2003 dollars. The New Expenditure Plan is fiscally constrained to the total funding expected to be available for each category. The financial constraint is further detailed within each category through the specification of funding priority levels (Priorities 1, 2 and 3). There are four categories, identified with capital letters (A through D). The first subdivision level under each category is known as a subcategory.

The amounts in this column are provided in fulfillment of Sections 131051 (a)(1), (b) and (c) of the Public Utilities Code. \n2\nPercentages are based Prop K Priority 1 and 2 forecasts of $2.626 billion.\n3\nWith very limited exceptions, the funds included in the 30-year forecast of expected revenues are for capital projects rather than operations. Of all the funding sources that make up the $12.4 B in expected funding, paratransit operating support is only eligible for Prop K and up to 10% of MUNI's annual share of Federal Section 5307 funds (currently about $3.5 M annually). Therefore, total expected funding for Paratransit only reflects Prop K and Section 5307. The remaining paratransit operating costs for the next 30-years will be funded using other sources of operating funds, such as those currently included in MUNI's $460 M annual operating budget. \n4\nPriority 3 projects will only be funded if the revenues materialize under the optimistic scenario for sales tax revenues. They are also included in case Priority 1 or 2 projects realize costs savings, identify other unanticipated sources of funding, experience delays or are canceled. \n5\nThe \"Total Prop K\" fulfills the requirements in Section 131051(d) of the Public Utilities Code.\n     4.     DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS \n     This section contains detailed descriptions of the projects, categories and subcategories in the New Expenditure Plan, and the types of items that are eligible for funding under each of them.

Programmatic categories are set up to address allocation of funds to multi-year programs for a given purpose, such as the maintenance of traffic signals, for which not all specific project locations can be anticipated or identified at the time of adoption of the Expenditure Plan. \n     B.     PRIORITIZATION PROCESS \n     For programmatic categories and for projects involving multiple agencies, subsequent to approval of the Expenditure Plan, the Authority Board shall designate a lead agency responsible for prioritizing the program of projects for the category, and for implementing the project(s). \n     Prior to allocation of any sales tax funds, the lead agency shall prepare, in close consultation with all other affected planning and implementation agencies and the Authority, a 5-year prioritized program of projects (for programmatic categories) including budget, scope and schedule; or a 5-year project delivery timetable, budget and scope (for individual projects) consistent with the Strategic Plan for use of the Prop K funds, for review and adoption by the Authority Board. Program goals shall be consistent with the Countywide Transportation Plan and with the City's General Plan. \n     The program of projects shall at a minimum address, the following factors: \n     Project readiness, including schedule for completion of environmental and design phases; well-documented preliminary cost estimates, and documented community support as appropriate; \n     Compatibility with existing and planned land uses, and with adopted standards for urban design and for the provision of pedestrian amenities; and supportiveness of planned growth in transit-friendly housing, employment and services. \n     A prioritization mechanism to rank projects within the program, addressing, for each proposed project: \n     Relative level of need or urgency \n     Cost Effectiveness \n     A fair geographic distribution that takes into account the various needs of San Francisco's neighborhoods. \n     Funding plan, including sources other than Prop K \n     The lead agency shall conduct appropriate public outreach to ensure an inclusive planning process for the development of the program of projects, as well as general plan referral or referral to any City Department or Commission as required. \n     The lead agency shall also identify appropriate performance measures, such as increased system connectivity, increased transit ridership (net new riders), reductions in travel time for existing riders, and increased use of alternatives to the single-occupant automobile; as well as milestone targets and a timeline for achieving them, to ensure that progress is made in meeting the goals and objectives of the program. \n     These performance measures shall be developed in collaboration with the Authority, shall be consistent with Congestion Management Program requirements and guidelines issued by the Authority, and shall be submitted for review and approval by the Authority. \n     The lead agency shall be eligible for planning funds from this category for the purpose of completing the development of the program of projects. Lead agencies will also be encouraged to explore alternative and non-traditional methods for project and service delivery where they offer opportunities for increased cost-effectiveness and/or shortened project delivery timelines. \n     As part of the Strategic Plan development process, the Authority shall adopt, issue and update detailed guidelines for the development of programs of projects, including further detail on the definition and application of the concept of land use/housing-supportive transportation projects as referenced in 4.A.i. Transit-Major Capital Projects, as well as for the development of project scopes, schedules and budgets. \n     6.     ALLOCATION AND RE-ALLOCATION OF FUNDS \n     Each New Expenditure Plan program or project (see definition in Section 3 above) shall be funded using sales tax revenue up to the total amount for that program or project in Priority 1. If, after funding all Priority 1 projects in a subcategory, the latest Prop K Strategic Plan Update cash flow analysis forecasts available revenues in excess of Priority 1 levels, the Authority Board may allow programming of Priority 2 revenues within the subcategory, subject to the category percentage caps and program or project dollar amount caps for Priority 2 established in the New Expenditure Plan. After funding at least 80% of Priority 2 project dollar amounts, the Authority Board may program Priority 3 requests, if the latest Prop K Strategic Plan forecasts revenues beyond the total Priority 2 level. \n     In the case of Major Capital Projects, the lead agency shall submit to the Authority Board for approval a schedule of project delivery milestones required to ensure that Prop K funds allocated to the project are obligated in a timely manner. The project delivery milestones shall include the completion of environmental clearances, securing of necessary project funding, and the start of construction or implementation. The Authority staff shall prepare a report at least annually, to the Authority Board, to communicate the status of these projects. If a project has not achieved any given project milestone within a period of 5 years, the funds earmarked for the project shall be subject to re-programming by the Transportation Authority Board, by a 2/3 vote. \n     7.     PROCESS \n     Pursuant to the provisions of Division 12.5 of the California Public Utilities Code, the Authority Board may adopt an updated Expenditure Plan anytime after twenty years from the effective date of adoption of the New Expenditure Plan, but no later than the last general election in which the New Expenditure Plan is in effect. In order to develop and adopt an updated Expenditure Plan, the Authority Board shall appoint an Expenditure Plan Update Advisory Committee, to develop the updated Expenditure Plan. A recommendation for adoption of the updated Expenditure Plan shall require a 2/3 vote of the Authority Board. \n     The following abbreviations are used for Sponsoring Agencies: \n\nBART\nBay Area Rapid Transit District\nCaltrans\nCalifornia Department of Transportation\nDAS\nDepartment of Administrative Services\nDOE\nDepartment of the Environment\nDPT\nDepartment of Parking and Traffic\nDPW\nDepartment of Public Works\nGGBHTD\nGolden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transit District\nMUNI\nSan Francisco Municipal Railway\nPCJPB\nPeninsula Corridor Joint Powers Board (Caltrain)\nPlanning\nPlanning Department\nSFCTA\nSan Francisco County Transportation Authority\nTJPA\nTransbay Joint Powers Authority\n     Attachment 1: Expenditure Plan Advisory Committee Roster \n\nTom Radulovich, Chair\nAt-Large Member\nGwyneth Borden, Vice Chair\nBusiness Advisory Group\nJim Bourgart\nBusiness Advisory Group\nGabriel Metcalf\nBusiness Advisory Group\nDuane Papierniak\nBusiness Advisory Group\nPatricia Tolar\nBusiness Advisory Group\nVal Menotti\nCAC Member\nJackie Sachs\nCAC Member\nRoger Peters\nCAC Member\nWil Din\nCAC Member\nArt Michel\nCAC Member\nJames Haas\nAt-Large Member\nJessie Lorenz\nAt-Large Member\nFran Martin\nAt-Large Member\nBruce M.
