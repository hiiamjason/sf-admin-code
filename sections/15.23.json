If timely, effective and coordinated mental health treatment is not provided to indigent and uninsured residents who are not seriously mentally ill, those residents are at risk of becoming seriously mentally ill and hence requiring more expensive and comprehensive mental health care from San Francisco. \n     (b)     Standards. The Department shall provide a single standard of mental health services access and care for indigent and uninsured residents of the City and County of San Francisco and Medi-Cal beneficiaries who are residents of the City and County of San Francisco. \n(Added by Ord. 194-05, File No. 051030, App. 7/29/2005)\n\n","heading":{"title":"15","chaptersection":"23. ","identifier":"15.23. ","catch_text":"MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR INDIGENT AND UNINSURED."}}
