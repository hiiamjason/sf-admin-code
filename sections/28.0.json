{"text":"\n     The Board of Supervisors finds that contracting with the City and County of San Francisco is an important municipal affair, and that the award of contracts to contractors who fail to deal with the City and County in good faith compromises the integrity of the contracting process and results in the improper expenditure of public funds. The Board of Supervisors recognizes that the City and County must afford contractors due process in any determination that precludes any individual or business entity from participating in the contracting process. This Chapter does not apply to a determination of nonresponsibility for a single contract or identifiable group of contracts, but for the broader determination of irresponsibility of a contractor for the general purpose of contracting with the City and County of San Francisco for a specified period. The Board of Supervisors therefore adopts this \nChapter 28 to prescribe standard procedures for the prosecution, determination and implementation of administrative debarments. \n(Added by Ord. 8-04, File No. 031503, App. 1/16/2004)\n\n","heading":{"title":"28","chaptersection":"0","identifier":"28.0","catch_text":"FINDINGS."}}
