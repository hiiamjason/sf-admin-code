{"text":"\n     \"Records,\" as defined in Section \n8.1 of this Code, shall for the purposes of this Chapter be divided into three classifications: current records, storage records and permanent records. \n     \"Current records\" are records which for convenience, ready reference or other reason are retained in office space and equipment of the department involved. \n     \"Storage records\" are records which need not be retained in office space and equipment of the department involved, but which must be, or should be, prudently preserved for a time or permanently in the facilities of a records center, as specified in the following section. \n     \"Permanent records\" are records required by law to be permanently retained. Unless otherwise required by law or regulation, permanent records shall be stored by microfilming the paper records or placing them on an optical imaging storage system, placing the original film or tape in a State-approved storage vault and delivering a copy to the department. The paper records may then be destroyed. \n(Ord. No. 7070(1939), Sec. 3; amended by Ord. 530-88, App. 12/16/88)\n\n","heading":{"title":"8","chaptersection":"4","identifier":"8.4","catch_text":"RECORDS CLASSIFICATIONS."}}
