{"text":"\n     An Order of Debarment shall provide for a term of debarment not to exceed five years from the date of the Order. The Order shall prohibit any named contractor and the contractor's affiliates from participating in any contract at any tier, directly or indirectly, with or for the City and County; any contractor and the contractor's affiliates named in an Order of Debarment shall be deemed irresponsible and disqualified for the purposes of all City and County contracts. Upon such Order, any department head, board or commission may cancel any existing contract with a debarred contractor or direct the cancellation of an existing subcontract to which a debarred contractor is a party. In the event of such cancellation, no recovery shall be had on that contract by the debarred party other than for work satisfactorily completed as of the date of cancellation. \n     Administrative Debarment shall neither exclude nor preclude any other administrative or legal action taken by the City and County. \n     Violation of an Order of Debarment, such as by submission of a proposal, bid or sub-bid during the debarment period, may be considered a false claim as provided in this Administrative Code and the California Government Code. \n(Added by Ord. 8-04, File No. 031503, App. 1/16/2004)\n\n","heading":{"title":"28","chaptersection":"12. ","identifier":"28.12. ","catch_text":"TERM AND EFFECT OF ADMINISTRATIVE DEBARMENT; VIOLATION OF ORDER."}}
