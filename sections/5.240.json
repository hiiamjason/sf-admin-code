{"text":"\n     There shall be established a City Hall Preservation Advisory Commission for the purpose of ensuring that City Hall is maintained and preserved in a manner befitting its historic and architectural significance. San Francisco's City Hall is maintained and preserved in a manner befitting its historic and architectural significance. San Francisco's City Hall is a national landmark and a valued legacy to the people of this City. After its completion in 1915, it suffered a process of gradual alteration and degradation until the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 forced its temporary closure. Inadequate repair and maintenance contributed to the decline. Between 1989 and 2000, in addition to earthquake retrofitting, the City did extensive work to repair and refurbish City Hall and to reverse many alterations which had compromised the building's historical integrity. This Commission is intended to be an advisory body responsible for ensuring that the building's historical character and beauty are preserved henceforth and that the facilities are maintained according to the highest standard and not allowed to fall into disrepair. \n(Added by Ord. 40-04, File No. 031937, App. 3/20/2004)\n\n","heading":{"title":"5","chaptersection":"240","identifier":"5.240","catch_text":"ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE."}}
