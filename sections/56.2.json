{"text":"\n     (a)     The purpose of this Chapter is to strengthen the public planning process by encouraging private participation in the achievement of comprehensive planning goals and reducing the economic costs of development. A development agreement reduces the risks associated with development, thereby enhancing the City's ability to obtain public benefits beyond those achievable through existing ordinances and regulations. To accomplish this purpose the procedures, requirements and other provisions of this Chapter are necessary to promote orderly growth and development (such as, where applicable and appropriate, provision of housing, employment and small business opportunities to all segments of the community including low income persons, minorities and women), to ensure provision for adequate public services and facilities at the least economic cost to the public, and to ensure community participation in determining an equitable distribution of the benefits and costs associated with development. \n     (b)     Such agreements shall only be used for (1) affordable housing developments or (2) large multi-phase and/or mixed-use developments involving public improvements, services, or facilities installations, requiring several years to complete, as defined below in Section \n56.3, or a housing development with a minimum of 1,000 units, as defined below in Section \n56.3; or (3) rental housing developments with on-site affordable units, as defined below in Section \n56.3. \n(Added by Ord. 372-88, App. 8/10/88; amended by Ord. 67-05, File No. 041748, App. 4/15/2005; Ord. 312, File No. 100046, App. 12/23/2010) \n\n","heading":{"title":"56","chaptersection":"2. ","identifier":"56.2. ","catch_text":"PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY."}}
