{"text":"\nLEGAL TEXT OF PROPOSITION K \n     It is the policy of the City and County of San Francisco to acknowledge the particular housing needs of persons with limited financial resources (1) who are Seniors 60 years of age or older and/or (2) who are disabled adults, and to explore means of addressing these needs. For example, exploration could involve the City's Residential Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program (San Francisco Planning Code sections \n315 et seq.), and possible grants or other financial incentives for development of senior housing. \n     These valued members of our community should not be expected to allot more than 30% of their monthly financial benefits for rent. However, many of these individuals are currently paying half or more of their financial resources for rent, which often does not leave enough to cover needed medications, food, transportation, clothing, laundry, and other living expenses. They are faced with the debilitating challenge of going without basic necessities, and put at risk for homelessness. Many have previously been evicted pursuant to the state's Ellis Act (which permits owners to remove properties from the residential rental market.) \n     This policy will assist in addressing these significant life issues in San Francisco. \n(Added by Proposition K, Approved 11/7/2006)\n\n","heading":{"title":"77:","identifier":"77:","catch_text":"- POLICY RELATING TO THE HOUSING NEEDS OF SENIORS AND DISABLED ADULTS"}}
