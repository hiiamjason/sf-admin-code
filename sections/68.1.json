The goal of cultural equity will be achieved when all the people that make up the City have fair access to the information, financial resources and opportunities vital to full cultural expression, and the opportunity to be represented in the development of arts policy and the distribution of arts resources; when all the cultures and subcultures of the City are expressed in thriving, visible arts organizations of all sizes; when new large-budget arts institutions flourish whose programming reflects the experiences of historically underserved communities, such as: African American; Asian American; disabled; Latino; lesbian and gay; Native American; Pacific Islander; and, women. \n(Added by Ord. 354-93, App. 11/12/93)\n\n","heading":{"title":"68","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"68.1","catch_text":"PURPOSES."}}
