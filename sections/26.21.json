If the violation is of a continuing nature, the Hearing Officer may impose a penalty for each day the violation remains. \n     If payment of any administrative penalty imposed by the Hearing Officer is not received by the City Administrator within the period of time set forth in the decision, and the decision has not been appealed under the time periods set forth in Section \n26.22, the City Administrator shall request that the Tax Collector pursue collection of the penalty and fee against the owner of the Deemed Approved Off-Sale Alcohol Use, up to and including imposition of a special assessment lien in accordance with the requirements of Article 26 of \nChapter 10 of the San Francisco Administrative Code (commencing with Section \n10.230). In the event that the unpaid administrative penalty is owed by an owner of a Deemed Approved Off-Sale Alcohol Use who is not also the property owner of the building in which the use is located, the City Administrator may request that the City Attorney pursue collection of the penalties. \n     Any administrative penalties collected under this Chapter shall be deposited in the Deemed Approved Off-Sale Alcohol Use Continuing Project Account, as set forth in Section \n26.27. \n(Added by Ord. 43-06, File No. 051792, App. 3/10/2006)\n\n","heading":{"title":"26","chaptersection":"21","identifier":"26.21","catch_text":"ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTIES."}}
