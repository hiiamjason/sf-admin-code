City and County of San Francisco (Sup. Ct. No. 421249). When any provision of local law refers to \nChapter 12D.A of the Administrative Code or any other contracting program enjoined by the court's order of July 26, 2004, it shall be read as referring instead to \nChapter 14A as set forth in this emergency ordinance. \n     This ordinance shall govern all contracts initiated on or after July 26, 2004 and any Amendment to a Pre-existing Contract as that term is defined in Section \n14A.4 and as those contracts are governed by Section \n14A.14(k). \n(Added by Ord. 208-04, File No. 041117, App. 8/11/2004)\n\n","heading":{"title":"14A","chaptersection":"02","identifier":"14A.02","catch_text":"OPERATIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY."}}
