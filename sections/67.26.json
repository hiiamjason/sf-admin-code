The work of responding to a public-records request and preparing documents for disclosure shall be considered part of the regular work duties of any City employee, and no fee shall be charged to the requester to cover the personnel costs of responding to a records request. \n(Added by Ord. 265-93, App. 8/18/93; amended by Proposition G, 11/2/99)\n\n","heading":{"title":"67","chaptersection":"26","identifier":"67.26","catch_text":"WITHHOLDING KEPT TO A MINIMUM."}}
