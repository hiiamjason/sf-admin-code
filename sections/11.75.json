The notice of violation shall contain specific allegations, setting forth the violations of this Chapter, a Franchise, or a UCP, shall specify the manner in which the violation must be remedied, and shall state whether the Department intends to seek suspension of excavation permits pursuant to Section \n11.83 below.
