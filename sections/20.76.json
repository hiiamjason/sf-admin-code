For Family Budget Units in which members receive cash payments from more than one federal, State or County assistance program, except for SSI/SSP, the total aid payment shall consist of the sum of each individual's proportionate share of the aid payment for a family budget unit of the same size within each program for which each member is eligible. \n     (b)     The maximum monthly PAES stipend for which an applicant is eligible shall be the maximum monthly PAES stipend prorated as of the eligibility determination date, minus any nonexempt cash available to the applicant during that calendar month, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property available to the applicant during that calendar month, and minus the value of any prorated in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the applicant. A rent payment, retroactive to the first of the month in which eligibility is determined, may be authorized to prevent eviction from existing housing. \n     (c)     The maximum monthly PAES stipend for which a participant is eligible shall be the maximum PAES stipend minus any nonexempt cash received from sources other than PAES which is available to the participant during the month for which the stipend is paid, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property which is, or will be, available to the participant during the month for which the stipend is paid, and minus the value of any in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the participant. \n     (d)     No PAES stipend shall be issued for less than $5.00.\n     (e)     PAES assistance and stipends may be provided in the form of vouchers, checks, two-party checks, warrants, electronic benefit transfers, in-kind benefits, and/or through third party contracts. \n     (f)     PAES stipends may be made payable only to the participant or, upon the participant's written authorization, to the participant and a designated co-payee, or to a representative payee. \n     (g)     PAES stipends may be mailed directly to the participant or to the designated representative payee. PAES stipends may be made by electronic benefits transfer. PAES stipends may be picked up at a location designated by the Department. PAES stipends shall not be mailed to a post office box, a mail receiving service, or to an address outside the City and County of San Francisco, except upon specific authorization of the Executive Director. \n     (h)     The Maximum PAES Stipend Amounts listed in Section \n20.76(a) of this Article shall be increased by any annual percentage cost of living increase to the Maximum Aid Payment, and according to the same schedule, if such an increase is implemented by the State of California in the TANF/CalWORKs program. \n     (i)     Participants may be provided with assistance, as specified in Subsection (e) above, to help pay, in full or in part, ancillary work-related expenses. \n     (j)     Applicants and recipients are required to provide a verifiable rent receipt, or verifiable documentation of shared housing, or verifiable documentation of rent-free housing. Self-declared homeless applicants and recipients shall receive in-kind benefits for housing, utilities and meals. If in-kind benefits are not available, such applicants and recipients shall receive the income-in-kind value of housing, utilities, and/or meals, whichever is not available, if otherwise eligible for these amounts. Failure to comply with the rules of a housing program that results in ejection from that housing program will be considered failure to satisfy the requirements for continuing eligibility for aid and will result in discontinuance from PAES, subject to the notice and hearing provisions of this Article. \n     (k)     A special allowance of up to $59.00 per month shall be made available to any recipient when the income-in-kind value of housing, and/or utilities, and/or meals provided to that recipient exceeds the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible. If such income-in-kind value does not exceed the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible, but allows for less than $59.00 cash per month, that recipient shall receive an amount that, when added to the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible, equals $59.00 cash per month. This section shall not affect the collection of overpayments due to fraud, negligent failure to report facts or administrative error as set forth in this Article. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002; Ord. 93-07, File No. 070208, App. 4/27/2007)\n\n","heading":{"title":"20","chaptersection":"76","identifier":"20.76","catch_text":"PAES STIPENDS."}}
