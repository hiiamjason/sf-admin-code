{"text":"\n     The Working Families Credit Program shall be administered by the San Francisco Human Services Agency (HSA). Beginning in Fiscal Year 2005-2006, the program will provide an incentive payment to working families who qualify for the Working Families Credit from the Treasurer's Working Families Credit Fund established in Section 10.100-347. The incentive payment may be based on a percentage of the family's federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or a flat rate established by the City. HSA shall work with the Treasurer, the Controller, other City departments, and community stakeholders to develop the program. HSA also may enter into agreements with private industries to provide participants in the Working Families Credit Program with services or products that are offered at below-market rates and that are beneficial to the participants and their families. The Treasurer may develop and implement programs that encourage responsible savings and investment practices. This legislation is not intended to result in a reduction in the level of public assistance to which participants in the Working Families Credit Program would otherwise be entitled. \n(Added by Ord. 194-04, File No. 040737, App. 7/30/2004) (Former Sec. 12S.1 added by Ord. 214-01, File No. 011167, App. 11/2/2001; repealed by Ord. 171-03.
