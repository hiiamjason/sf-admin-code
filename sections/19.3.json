{"text":"\n     The City and County of San Francisco may install community safety cameras for the purpose of enhancing public security only in locations experiencing substantial crime and where the potential to deter criminal activity outweighs any concerns asserted by the affected community as determined by the Police Commission. The cameras shall record areas perceptible to the human eye from public streets and sidewalks only. Images obtained by the community safety cameras may be released only to the following: \n     (a)     Sworn members of the San Francisco Police Department holding the rank of Inspector or higher. Police shall limit review of images to investigation of specific crimes; and \n     (b)     The Public Defender, other criminal defense attorney, or an investigator appointed by the Court to assist a pro se criminal defendant. Requests may be made only in connection with the investigation or defense of a charged criminal case. Any recordings released may be used only in connection with the charged criminal case. The requesting individual may disclose the recording only to the defendant and any expert retained by the requesting individual, and to no other individual. This Subsection (b) shall not preclude the requesting individual from disclosing any recording during a hearing or trial in the charged criminal case if the Court approves such disclosure. Any person who discloses a recording in violation of this Subsection (b) shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and may be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00, imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months, or both such fine and imprisonment; and \n     (c)     The District Attorney as provided in Section \n19.6.\n(Added by Ord. 127-06, File No. 060086, App. 6/22/2006; Ord. 32-08, File No. 071536)\n\n","heading":{"title":"19","chaptersection":"3. ","identifier":"19.3. ","catch_text":"LIMITATIONS ON COMMUNITY SAFETY CAMERAS."}}
