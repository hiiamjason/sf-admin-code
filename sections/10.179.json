In order to recover the cost to the City for the District Attorney to participate in the operation of the Community Courts Program, as described in Section \n10.100-295 of this Code, the City will collect a Community Court Program Administrative Fee as follows: \n     (b)     Collection of Fee. The District Attorney is authorized to collect the Administrative Fee from persons who are determined by the District Attorney to be eligible for the Community Court Program and who elect to participate in the Program. The District Attorney shall explain the basis and amount of any fee to each person in advance of his or her participation in the Community Court Program. The District Attorney is also authorized to collect the Administrative Fee from persons who are eligible for and who elect to participate in the Program but whose cases are heard in an administrative office because there is no Community Court in the neighborhood in which the incident or dispute occurred. \n     (c)     Amount of Fee. Consistent with the Dispute Resolution Program Act (California Business and Professions Code section 465 et seq. and implementing regulations at 16 California Administrative Code section 3600 et seq.), the Administrative Fee shall be assessed on a sliding scale basis. Individuals whose income and resources fall below 60 percent of the Area Median Income for individuals shall pay no Administrative Fee. Individuals whose income and resources are at or above 60 percent of the Area Median Income for individuals shall pay $115.00 per case. A business participating in the Community Courts Program shall pay $165.00 per case. Beginning with fiscal year 2005-2006, the Controller shall each year review and adjust the Administrative Fees set in this Section without further action by the Board of Supervisors to ensure that the Administrative Fees produce sufficient revenue to support the District Attorney's participation in the Community Court Program, but do not produce revenue that exceeds that necessary to support the District Attorney's participation. \n     (d)     No Additional Fees. No agency providing dispute resolution services through the Community Court Program may collect any additional administrative fees from participants in the Community Courts Program. \n     (e)     Use of Fee. Consistent with the budgetary and fiscal provisions of the Charter, proceeds received from collection of the Administrative Fee shall be used to recover the costs to the City for the District Attorney to participate in the operation of the Community Courts Program. \n(Added by Ord. 189-05, File No. 051001, App. 7/29/2005; Ord. 87-06, File No. 051917, App. 5/5/2006)\nSEC. 10.184.\n(Added by Ord. 225-71, App. 9/2/71; repealed by Ord. 318-00, File No. 001913, App. 12/28/2000)\nSEC. 10.187.\n(Added by Ord. 606-81, App. 12/24/81; repealed by Ord. 318-00, File No. 001913, App. 12/28/2000)\nSEC. 10.191.\n(Amended by Ord. 273-72, App. 9/20/72; repealed by Ord. 318-00, File No. 001913, App. 12/28/2000)\nSEC. 10.192.\n(Added by Ord. 261-75, App. 6/11/75; repealed by Ord. 318-00, File No. 001913, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.193-1.  FIRST OFFENDER PROSTITUTION PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE FEE.\n     (a)     Collection Fee.

The fee authorized by Subsection (a) shall be set by the District Attorney to cover the cost of administering the First Offender Prostitution Program but shall not exceed $500. The District Attorney may establish reduced fee rates for individuals who lack the financial capability to pay the full fee. In no event shall the reduced fee be less than $100 for any individual participant. \n     (c)     Fee Modification. The District Attorney shall examine the fee annually to ensure that it continues to reflect the costs of the services provided by the program. If the District Attorney finds that the maximum authorized fee does not cover the costs of the services provided or that the minimum authorized fee exceeds the costs of the services provided, the District Attorney shall prepare and submit a resolution for approval by the Board of Supervisors to modify the maximum or minimum authorized fee, effective as of the beginning of the following fiscal year. \n     (d)     Timing of Payment. The District Attorney shall collect the fee at the time an individual enrolls in the First Offender Prostitution Program. The fee must be paid in full before an individual may participate in the program. \n     (e)     Administration of Funds. Proceeds received from collection of the fee under this Section shall be used to defray the costs of administering the First Offender Prostitution Program, subject to the budget and fiscal provisions of the Charter. \n(Added by Ord. 289-98, App. 9/18/98)\nARTICLE XVII:\n[RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE XVIII:\nGENERAL FUND COST RECOVERY PROCEDURES \n\n\nSec. 10.194.\nPurposes. \n\nSec. 10.195.\nController's Duties. \n\nSec. 10.196.\nAnnual Survey. \n\nSec. 10.197.\nComputation of General Service Charge. \n\nSec. 10.198.\nDepartmental Budget Estimates. \n\nSec. 10.199.\nController's Review. \n\nSEC. 10.194.  PURPOSES.\n     Many of San Francisco's departments, offices, agencies, boards and commissions funded in whole or in part by the General Fund as defined below (hereinafter referred to as service rendering agencies) render services or provide facilities to other San Francisco departments, offices, agencies, boards and commissions funded in whole or in part by special funds as defined below (hereinafter referred to as recipient agencies). \n     The General Fund is derived from a number of taxes and other general revenue devices, the proceeds of which are not earmarked for specific purposes and are not deemed to fall into the category of special revenues. All other revenues are special revenues and fall into special revenue funding. This ordinance makes a mutually exclusive distinction between the General Fund and Special Revenue Funds. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.195.  CONTROLLER'S DUTIES.\n     The San Francisco Controller (hereinafter referred to as the Controller) shall be charged with the responsibility for the administration of this Article. \n     The Controller shall prepare those budgetary procedures, regulations, reporting requirements and guidelines sufficient to enable him or her to determine for each service rendering agency the costs of its operation to the extent services are rendered or facilities provided to recipient agencies and, if not funded directly by recipient agencies, to allocate the cost of that operation on and amongst recipient agencies to the extent that these recipient agencies are funded from Special Fund sources. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.196.  ANNUAL SURVEY.\n     The Controller shall on an annual basis conduct a survey to determine which San Francisco agencies render services or provide facilities to (other San Francisco) non General Fund agencies and how much in terms of services and facilities are provided on an annual basis by each service rendering agency to each recipient agency. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.197.  COMPUTATION OF GENERAL SERVICE CHARGE.\n     Based on the aforementioned services, the Controller shall calculate the total cost of services rendered and facilities provided by all service rendering agencies to each recipient agency and, on a recipient agency by recipient agency basis, shall interpret that total cost into a specific percentage of each rendering agency's total annual expenditures. This percentage shall be known as the general service charge. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.198.  DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET ESTIMATES.\n     Each recipient agency as part of its annual budget estimate shall include in that estimate an allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund sufficient to defray the anticipated cost of services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by all rendering agencies, calculated on the basis of its general service charge prepared by the Controller. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.199.  CONTROLLER'S REVIEW.\n     The Controller shall on an annual basis, as part of his or her duties in reviewing budget estimates submitted to him or her and consolidated by him or her for transmission to the Mayor, verify that the annual budget for each recipient agency contains an allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund sufficient to fund the cost of services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by all rendering agencies. In those cases where the Controller determines that the recipient agency has failed in its budget estimate to make the allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund to defray the cost of rendering services or providing facilities to all service rendering agencies, calculated pursuant to its general service charge, the Controller shall make the appropriate allocation by reducing expenditures for other items in the budget estimates. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80; amended by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.199-1.\n(Amended by Ord. 59-83, App. 2/4/83; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.201.\n(Added by Ord. 58-82, App. 2/11/82; amended by Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.203.\n(Added by Ord. 342-87, App. 8/21/87; amended by Ord. 283-90, App. 7/24/90; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.204.\n(Added by Ord. 416-93, App. 12/23/93; amended by Ord. 79-96, App. 2/23/96; Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.205.\n(Added by Ord. 376-96, App. 9/30/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nARTICLE XIX:\n[RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE XX:\nLIEN PROCEDURE \n\n\nSec. 10.230.\nApplicability.\n\nSec. 10.230A.\nRequest for Payment; Notice of Delinquent Account and Proposed Lien; Authorization for Lien.\n\nSec. 10.231.\nReport to Board of Supervisors.\n\nSec. 10.232.\nNotice of Hearing.\n\nSec. 10.233.\nHearing.\n\nSec. 10.234.\nCreation of Lien.\n\nSec. 10.235.\nRecordation.\n\nSec. 10.236.\nFiling With Controller and Tax Collector; Distribution of Proceeds.\n\nSec. 10.237.\nRelease of Lien, Recording Fee. \n\nSEC. 10.230.  APPLICABILITY.\n     The following procedures are adopted pursuant to California Government Code Section 54988 and/or the Charter City Powers of City and County of San Francisco. Where an ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco authorizes the creation and imposition of a lien to enforce financial obligations owed to the City and County of San Francisco, the procedure set forth herein shall govern unless a different lien procedure is specifically provided for. If another ordinance of the City and County authorizes a different lien procedure which is subsequently declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the procedures set forth in this Article shall apply. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.230A.  REQUEST FOR PAYMENT; NOTICE OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNT AND PROPOSED LIEN; AUTHORIZATION FOR LIEN.\n     (a)     Prior to initiating proceedings under this Article for the imposition of a lien, the department seeking to collect the fee, charge or cost at issue shall mail the property owner a written request for payment. If the fee, charge or cost has not been paid within 30 calendar days of such notice, the department may initiate lien proceedings pursuant to this Article to recover the amount due. Where another ordinance authorizing a specific lien requires not less than 30 calendar days written notice to the property owner prior to the initiation of lien proceedings, that notice shall constitute compliance with this Subsection. \n     (b)     A department seeking to initiate lien proceedings shall, following the end of the 30 calendar day period set forth in subsection (a), send the property owner via certified mail a written notice of proposed lien that shall include information as to the amount due, instructions for payment, and the name and telephone number of a department official to contact for questions or further information. The notice shall further state that if the amount due is not paid within 45 days, it shall be considered a delinquent account subject to lien pursuant to this Article and that before the lien may be imposed, the property owner has the right to appear before the Board of Supervisors at a hearing regarding the amount due. The notice shall also state that if the obligation remains unpaid, administrative fees, penalties and interest (including interest on amounts due after they have become a lien and continuing until paid) pursuant to this Article will accrue and become part of the lien. \n     (c)     To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien does not provide for notice, or establishes lesser notice requirements, this section shall establish minimum notice requirements. To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien establishes greater or additional notice requirements, those notice requirements shall control. The provisions of this section are not intended to affect any notice requirements imposed by preemptive State or federal law. \n     (d)     A financial obligation that is subject to this Article, and which remains unpaid after 45 calendar days from the date of the notice required pursuant to subsection (b) shall be deemed a delinquent account. In accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article, the Board of Supervisors may ensure collection of a delinquent account by making the amount thereof, along with any administrative charges, penalties, fees and interest, a lien against the subject property. \n(Added by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.231.  REPORT TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.\n     Each head of a department or office shall report not less than annually to the Board of Supervisors on delinquent accounts as provided herein.

All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ordinary municipal taxes shall be applicable to said lien, subject to two exceptions: (1) if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to the real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection; and (2) liens recorded pursuant to this Article shall only have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien unless State law confers a different priority. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.235.  RECORDATION.\n     The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall cause the confirmed and verified report to be recorded in the County Recorder's office.

Where the costs for which the lien is imposed have been paid from the General Fund instead of departmental funds, the sums collected shall be deposited in the General Fund, and not allocated to the department for which the lien was imposed. Unless otherwise authorized by law, the proceeds of the lien transferred to the department may be used only to fund the activities or undertakings the charge leading to the lien was designed to fund. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.237.  RELEASE OF LIEN, RECORDING FEE.\n     Upon payment to the Tax Collector of the lien amount plus applicable penalties, administrative fees and interest charges, the Tax Collector shall cause to be recorded a Release of Lien with the County Recorder, and from the sum collected pursuant to Section \n10.236, shall pay to the County Recorder a Release of Lien fee of $9.00. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\nCHAPTER 10A:\n[RESERVED]\nSEC. 10A.1.  RESERVED.\n(Added by Ord. 274-06, File No. 060700)\nEditor's Note:     Former Ch. 10A (\"Pilot Foot Patrol Program\") expired by operation of its sunset provision on 1/1/2008.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
