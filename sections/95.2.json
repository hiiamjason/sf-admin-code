When requiring members of the public to provide identification or proof of residency in the City, each City department and any Entity That Receives City Funds shall accept a Municipal Identification Card as valid identification and as valid proof of residency in the City, unless such City department or Entity has reasonable grounds for determining that the card is counterfeit, altered, or improperly issued to the card holder, or that the individual presenting the card is not the individual to whom it was issued. \n     Other than requiring the City and Entities That Receive City Funds to accept the Card as proof of identification and City residency, this Section is not intended to replace any other existing requirements for issuance of other forms of identification in connection with the administration of City benefits and services. The requirements of this Section do not apply under circumstances where (1) a Federal or State statute, administrative regulation or directive, or court decision requires the City or Entity That Receives City Funds to obtain different identification or proof of residence, (2) a Federal or State statute or administrative regulation or directive preempts local regulation of identification or residency requirements, or (3) the City or Entity That Receives City Funds would be unable to comply with a condition imposed by a funding source, which would cause the City or such Entity to lose funds from that source. \n     (g)     City Undertaking Limited to Promotion of General Welfare. In undertaking the enforcement of this ordinance, the City is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury. \n     (h)     Provisions of Ordinance Not Severable. The Board of Supervisors intends that all the provisions of this ordinance function as an interdependent whole. If a court rules that the City may not implement or enforce any provision of this ordinance, then all City officers and employees shall henceforth cease implementing and enforcing all provisions of this ordinance. \n(Added by Ord. 274-07, File No. 071333, App. 11/28/2007; Ord. 279-08, File No. 081376, App. 11/25/2008)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
