This needs assessment shall primarily focus on identifying the best location for farmers' markets in underserved neighborhoods. This needs assessment shall be submitted to the Clerk of Board of Supervisors on an annual basis. \n(Added by Ord. 29-07, File No. 061112, App. 2/16/2007)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
