{"text":"\nAdopted June 5, 1984 \n     An Ordinance which prohibits building permits for certain structures which will cast a substantial shadow on Recreation and Park Department property, except on prior approval of the City Planning Commission pursuant to the ordinance, with certain exceptions. \n     Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: \n     No building permit authorizing the construction of any structure that will cast any shade or shadow upon any property under the jurisdiction of, or designated for acquisition by, the Recreation and Park Commission may be issued except upon prior action of the City Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of this ordinance; provided, however, that the provisions of this ordinance shall not apply to building permits authorizing: structures which do not exceed 40 feet in height; structures which cast a shade or shadow upon property under the jurisdiction of, or designated for acquisition by, the Recreation and Park Commission only during the first hour after sunrise and/or the last hour before sunset; structures to be constructed on property under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park Commission for recreational and park-related purposes; structures of the same height and in the same location as structures in place on June 6, 1984; projects for which a building permit application has been filed and either: \n          (i)     a public hearing has been held prior to March 5, 1984 on a draft environmental impact report published by the Department of City Planning, or \n          (ii)     a Negative Declaration has been published by the Department of City Planning prior to the date of adoption of this initiative ordinance; or projects for which a building permit application and an application for environmental evaluation have been filed prior to March 5, 1984 and which involve physical integration of new construction with rehabilitation of a building designated as historic either by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors as a historical landmark or by the State Historic Preservation Officer as a State Historic Landmark, or placed by the United States Department of the Interior on the National Register of Historic Places and which are located on sites that, but for separation by a street or alley, are adjacent to such historic building. \n     The City Planning Commission shall conduct a hearing and shall disapprove the issuance of any building permit governed by the provisions of this ordinance if it finds that the proposed project will have any adverse impact on the use of the property under the jurisdiction of, or designated for acquisition by, the Recreation and Park Commission because of the shading or shadowing that it will cause, unless it is determined that the impact would be insignificant. \n     The City Planning Commission shall not make the determination required by the provisions of this subsection until the general manager of the Recreation and Park Department in consultation with the Recreation and Park Commission has had an opportunity to review and comment to the City Planning Commission upon the proposed project. The City Planning Commission and the Recreation and Park Commission, after a joint meeting, shall adopt criteria for the implementation of the provisions of this ordinance. \n     The zoning administrator shall determine which applications for building permits propose structures which will cast a shade or shadow upon property under the jurisdiction of, or designated for acquisition by, the Recreation and Park Commission. As used in this subsection, \"property designated for acquisition by the Recreation and Park Commission\" shall mean property which a majority of each of the Recreation and Park Commission and the City Planning Commission meeting jointly, with the concurrence of the Board of Supervisors, have recommended for acquisition from the open space acquisition and park renovation fund which property is to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park Commission. The provisions of this ordinance shall also be incorporated into the City Planning Code. \n\n","heading":{"title":"10:","identifier":"10:","catch_text":"- PARK SHADOW BAN"}}
