The Energy Efficiency Steering Committee (\"the Committee\") shall advise the Board of Supervisors on planning and decision-making regarding energy efficiency projects, and the spending and allocation of new monies for such purposes. \n     The Committee's recommendations shall be shaped by the following policies: \n          1.     The City should give priority in connection with energy efficiency spending to low income communities and communities that are disproportionately impacted by localized health and economic threats of toxic pollution; \n          2.     The City should create or adjust specific programs and policies to that ensure jobs and other economic benefits in energy efficiency and green sector industries specifically benefit low income San Francisco residents in targeted environmental justice communities; \n          3.     The City should have a model of interdepartmental collaboration and action and a targeted set of metrics upon which energy efficiency programs will be evaluated; \n          4.     The City should design and implement energy efficiency policies and programs to achieve health benefits in targeted environmental justice communities. \n(Added by Ord. 78-10, File No. 091444, App. 4/16/2010)\n\n","heading":{"title":"5","chaptersection":"91","identifier":"5.91","catch_text":"PURPOSES AND POLICIES."}}
