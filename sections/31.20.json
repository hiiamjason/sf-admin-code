{"text":"\n     (a)     The concept of a project is broadly defined by CEQA so that multiple actions of the same or of different kinds may often constitute a single project. This concept of a project permits all the ramifications of a public action to be considered together, and avoids duplication of review. \n     (b)     Early and timely evaluation of projects and preparation of EIRs shall be emphasized.\n     (c)     Only one initial study, negative declaration or EIR shall be required for each project.\n     (d)     For purposes of determining the appropriate time for evaluation of projects and preparation of EIRs pursuant to this Chapter, there shall be only one relevant decision by the City to carry out or approve, or not to carry out or approve, a project. However for other purposes there may be more than one determination by the same or separate boards, commissions and departments of the City, either discretionary or ministerial, affecting the carrying out or approval of the project. The authority and effectiveness of any other such determinations, including determinations by the Board of Appeals or any other appellate body, shall not be diminished by anything in this Chapter. \n     (e)     Only one evaluation of a project or preparation of an EIR shall occur in cases in which both the City and one or more other public agencies are to carry out or approve a project. In such cases the evaluation or preparation is performed by the lead agency, which agency is selected by reference to criteria in CEQA. \n     (f)     CEQA provides that a single initial study, negative declaration or EIR may be employed for more than one project, if all such projects are essentially the same in terms of environmental effects. Furthermore, an initial study, negative declaration or EIR prepared for an earlier project may be applied to a later project, if the circumstances of the projects are essentially the same. \n     (g)     Reference is made in CEQA to simultaneous consideration of multiple and phased projects, related projects, cumulative effects of projects, projects elsewhere in the region, existing and planned projects. \n     (h)     With respect to projects preceding CEQA, and projects for which evaluations and EIRs have already been completed, or on which substantial work has been performed, CEQA makes provision as to when, if at all, a new evaluation or EIR must be prepared. An effort shall be made, in preparation of evaluations and EIRs, to consider alternatives and thus avoid the need for such further review of the project. \n(Added by Ord. 40-01, File No. 001007, App. 3/16/2001)\n\nARTICLE IV:\nFEES\n\n\nSec. 31.21.\nAllocation of Costs. \n\nSec. 31.22.\nBasic Fees. \n\nSec. 31.23.\nOther Fees. \n\nSec. 31.23.1.\nCommunity Plan Fees. \n\nSEC. 31.21.  ALLOCATION OF COSTS.\n     (a)     The costs of initial evaluations, preparation of environmental impact reports, notices, hearings and other aspects of administering this Chapter 3.1 shall be borne as follows: \n          (1)     For a project to be carried out by the City: By the board, commission or department that is to carry out such project, as part of the budgeted project costs. \n          (2)     For a project to be carried out by any person other than the City: By such person.\n          (3)     For the taking of an appeal to the Planning Commission: By the appellant.\n(Added by Ord. 40-01, File No. 001007, App. 3/16/2001) (Former Sec. 31.21; added by Ord. 134-73, App. 4/11/73; repealed by Ord. 40-01) \n\nSEC. 31.22.  BASIC FEES.\n     (a)     The Planning Department shall charge the following basic fees to applicants for projects located outside of recently adopted Plan Areas (adopted after July 1, 2005) that do not require one or more of the following, which will be initiated through the adoption of an Area Plan: Code amendments for the height or bulk district and General Plan amendments, as specified in Section \n31.21 above: \n          (1)     For an initial study of a project excluding use of special expertise or technical assistance, as described in Section \n31.23 below, the initial fee shall be: \n               Where the total estimated construction cost as defined by the San Francisco Building Code is between $0 and $9,999: $1,092; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $10,000 or more, but less than $200,000: $4,249 PLUS 2.066% of the cost over $10,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $200,000 or more, but less than $1,000,000: $8,251 PLUS 1.562% of the cost over $200,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $1,000,000 or more, but less than $10,000,000: $20,987 PLUS 1.311% of the cost over $1,000,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $10,000,000 or more, but less than $30,000,000: $141,220 PLUS 0.404% of the cost over $10,000,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $30,000,000 or more, but less than $50,000,000: $ 223,531 PLUS 0.152% of the cost over $30,000,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $50,000,000 or more, but less than $100,000,000: $254,453 PLUS 0.037% of the cost over $50,000,000; \n               Where said total estimated construction cost is $100,000,000 or more: $272,962 PLUS 0.016% of the cost over $100,000,000. \n               An applicant proposing major revisions to a project application that has been inactive for more than six months and is assigned shall submit a new application.
