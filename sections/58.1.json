{"text":"\n     The City and County and San Francisco hereby declares itself the first \"Right to Civil Counsel City\" in the United States. This title is intended to represent the City and County's firm commitment to creating a local judicial system that provides representation to all residents involved in civil proceedings that could deny them basic human needs, such as child custody, shelter, sustenance, safety or health, regardless of their income or ability to pay.\n     The City and County of San Francisco declares its intent to work with the Courts, the Bar Association of San Francisco, and interested persons to progress steadily toward the goal of providing counsel whenever the court, in its discretion, believes that such counsel would assist in the fair administration of justice. This declaration is not intended to immediately establish a right to counsel in civil proceedings, but rather it is a codification of the beginning of a firm commitment to this eventual goal.\n(Added by Ord. 45-12, File No. 111189, App. 3/16/12, Eff. 4/15/12)\n\n","heading":{"title":"58","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"58.1","catch_text":"DECLARATION OF POLICY."}}
