{"text":"\n     The following method shall be used to calculate rent reductions: \n     (a)     Total daily rent is the monthly rent divided by 31;\n     (b)     Value of a room per day is the total daily rent divided by the number of rooms in the dwelling unit;\n     (c)     Days of lost use equals the number of days posted in the contractor's notice set forth in Section \n65.2 above or the actual number of days that the room is unavailable for use, whichever is greater; \n     (d)     Value of a room per day times the number of days of lost use times the number of rooms lost equals the rent reduction;\n     (e)     For purposes of Subsection (d) above, a legal kitchen which has lost its use is counted as two rooms. For purposes of Subsection (b) above, a legal kitchen counts as one room; \n     (f)     In addition to any rent reduction authorized by Subsection (d) above, there shall be a rent reduction of 100 percent of the total daily rent after the first four hours of loss of heat, electricity or water in one or more usable rooms. There shall be a like reduction for every 24-hour period, or fraction thereof, until the heat, electricity or water is restored. \n(Added by Ord. 220-92, App. 7/14/92)\n\n","heading":{"title":"65","chaptersection":"5. ","identifier":"65.5. ","catch_text":"RENT REDUCTION FORMULA."}}
