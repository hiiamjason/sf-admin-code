{"text":"\n     This Ordinance shall be known as the \"Automated Point of Sale Station Registration and Inspection Ordinance.\" It is unlawful under California Business and Professions Code sections 12024.2, 12024.6, and 12103.5 to charge, at the time of sale, a price that is more than the price that is advertised or posted. The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure that the advertised or posted price of a commodity is the correct price charged for that commodity. \n     This Chapter: (1) establishes a system to identify, register and inspect point of sale stations in retail commodity sales; (2) authorizes a registration fee to offset the expense of inspection of point of sale stations; (3) authorizes a re-inspection fee, equal to the registration fee, to offset the expense of revisiting and inspecting locations found out of compliance; and (4) provides penalties for failure to register or for late registration and for violations. \n     The Sealer of the Weights and Measures Division for the City and County shall administer and enforce this Chapter. \n     The standards for inspection and methods to gain compliance to ensure accurate pricing shall be those found in Division 5 of the California Business and Professions Code and Title 4 of the California Code of Regulations. \n(Added by Ord. 195-10, File No. 100725, App. 7/29/2010)\n\n","heading":{"title":"115","chaptersection":" ","identifier":"115. ","catch_text":"TITLE AND PURPOSE."}}
