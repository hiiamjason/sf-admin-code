A Contracting Officer may award contracts to more than one Offeror if the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the City's best interest to have more than one Contractor provide one or more similar Commodities and/or Services and the Solicitation states that the contract may be subject to multiple award. The Contracting Officer may either require all multiple award contractors to do business with the City under a single set of terms and conditions, or if the Solicitation is made by means of a request for Proposals, may negotiate separate terms and conditions with each Offeror for specified Commodities and/or Services. Following multiple award and in the administration of multiple award contracts, the Contracting Officer shall use best efforts to fulfill the policies of \nChapter 14B of this Code. \n     (b)     Technology Store.
