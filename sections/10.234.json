All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ordinary municipal taxes shall be applicable to said lien, subject to two exceptions: (1) if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to the real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection; and (2) liens recorded pursuant to this Article shall only have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien unless State law confers a different priority. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\n","heading":{"title":"10","chaptersection":"234. ","identifier":"10.234. ","catch_text":"CREATION OF LIEN."}}
