Such transmittal shall be made by the Mayor within 60 days after receipt of the Director of Property's report. \n     Upon receipt of the transmittal from the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors or a committee thereof shall hold a public hearing thereon, at which all interested departments and individuals shall be given an opportunity to be heard. \n     After such hearing, if the Board of Supervisors finds that the department having jurisdiction over Real Property no longer needs or has advantageous use therefor, or finds that the Real Property can be used more advantageously by the requesting department, the Board may, by resolution, order that the jurisdiction of such Real Property be transferred to the requesting department. \n     Any such transfer may be made without limit or for a limited period or under other conditions stated in the resolution. \n(Formerly Sec. 23.15; added by Ord.
