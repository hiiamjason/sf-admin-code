Title. \n     This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the \"Treatment on Demand Act\". \n     SECTION 2. Findings and Purpose. \n          a)     Substance abuse treatment services are essential services that provide hope and dignity for individuals and a pathway out of addiction, which may lead to homelessness and criminal activity. \n          b)     Substance abuse treatment services are a key component to San Francisco's Continuum of Care Plan, the official homeless policy of the City and County of San Francisco as approved by the Board of Supervisors on February 26, 2008 and by the Mayor on February 29, 2008. \n          c)     Over the past several years, the City and County of San Francisco has inconsistently prioritized substance abuse treatment services. \n          d)     As a result of these inconsistencies, many of the people in need of services are turned away for lack of available treatment slots. \n          e)     This initiative requires that the City and County of San Francisco provide a level of treatment services commensurate with the demand for these services. \n(Added by Proposition T, 11/4/2008)\n\nSEC. 19A.30.  MAINTENANCE OF TREATMENT ON DEMAND SERVICES.\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Department of Public Health shall maintain an adequate level of free and low cost medical substance abuse services and residential treatment slots commensurate with the demand for these services. \n     Demand shall be measured by the total number of filled medical substance abuse slots plus the total number of individuals seeking such slots as well as the total number of filled residential treatment slots plus the number of individuals seeking such slots. \n     The City and County shall be flexible in providing various treatment modalities for both residential substance abuse treatment services and medical substance abuse treatment services. \n     The Department of Public Health shall report to the Board of Supervisors by February 1st of each year with an assessment of the demand for substance abuse treatment and present a plan to meet this demand. This plan should also be reflected in the City budget. \n     The City and County shall not reduce funding, staffing or the number of substance abuse treatment slots available for as long as slots are filled or there is any number of individuals seeking such slots. \n     Nothing in this section shall diminish, interfere with or otherwise alter the Mayor's authority under Article III, section \n3.100(13) of the Charter. \n(Added by Proposition T, 11/4/2008)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
