{"text":"\n     When a Contracting Officer issues a Solicitation for Commodities and/or Services and no responsive and responsible Offers are received, the Contracting Officer shall review the Solicitation to determine whether the Solicitation could be altered and reissued in a manner that would be likely to attract responsive offers. If the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of responsive Offers is not due to the content of the Solicitation, the Contracting Officer may purchase the Commodities or Services called for from any source. If two or more Bids received are for the same amount or unit price and Such Bids are the lowest Bids from responsive and responsible Bidders, then the Contracting Officer may award a contract to either of the lowest responsive and responsible Bidders in accordance with the Purchaser's regulations. \n(Added by Ord. 156-99, File No. 990743, App. 6/2/99)\n\n","heading":{"title":"21","chaptersection":"6. ","identifier":"21.6. ","catch_text":"WHEN NO VALID OFFERS ARE RECEIVED; MULTIPLE LOW OFFERS."}}
