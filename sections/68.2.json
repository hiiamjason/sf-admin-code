{"text":"\n     The Fund is established upon the following principles: \n     (a)     It is the City's goal to achieve cultural equity, where every art form, from all segments of the population, has the opportunity to develop to its maximum potential. \n     (b)     The Fund programs should be implemented through a public process.\n     (c)     A healthy arts environment thrives at all levels. The productive vitality of individual artists, small and mid-size arts organizations, and grassroots cultural groups is as important to the City as the strength of the large-budget arts institutions. \n     (d)     The arts play a vital economic role in San Francisco. The Fund is established to assist in keeping all the arts healthy.\n     (e)     The Fund is established in the belief that the many cultural traditions which meet in San Francisco can thrive side by side and enrich each other. \n(Added by Ord. 354-93, App. 11/12/93)\n\n","heading":{"title":"68","chaptersection":"2. ","identifier":"68.2. ","catch_text":"PRINCIPLES FOR CULTURAL EQUITY ENDOWMENT FUND."}}
