{"text":"\n     (a)     This \nChapter 71 implements the Mills Act, California Government Code Sections 50280 et seq. The Mills Act authorizes local governments to enter into contracts with owners of private historical property who will rehabilitate, restore, preserve, and maintain qualified historical property. As consideration for the rehabilitation, restoration, preservation and maintenance of the qualified historical property, the City and County of San Francisco may provide certain property tax reductions in accordance with Article 1.9 (commencing with Section 439) of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of Division 1 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. \n     (b)     San Francisco contains many historic buildings that add to its character and international reputation. Many of these buildings have not been adequately maintained, may be structurally deficient, or may need rehabilitation. The costs of properly rehabilitating, restoring and preserving historic buildings may be prohibitive for property owners. Implementation of the Mills Act in San Francisco will make the benefits of the Mills Act available to many property owners. \n     (c)     The benefits of the Mills Act to the individual property owners must be balanced with the cost to the City and County of San Francisco of providing the property tax reductions set forth in the Mills Act as well as the historical value of individual buildings proposed for historical property contracts, and the resultant property tax reductions, under the Mills Act. \n(Added by Ord. 191-96, App. 5/22/96; amended by Ord. 271-09, File. No. 091137, App. 12/18/2009)\n\n","heading":{"title":"71","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"71.1","catch_text":"PURPOSE."}}
