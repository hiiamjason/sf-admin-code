{"text":"\n     A.     Information and communication technology (ICT) resources in the various departments, boards, commissions and agencies of the City and County of San Francisco (City Departments) are valuable strategic assets belonging to the people of San Francisco that must be managed accordingly. \n     B.     Advances in ICT are immense in scope and complexity, and progressing rapidly.\n     C.     The nature of the advances presents the City with the opportunity to provide higher quality, more timely, and more cost-effective governmental services. \n     D.     City Departments independently acquire uncoordinated and duplicative ICT technologies that are more appropriately acquired as part of a coordinated effort for maximum cost effectiveness and use. \n     E.     The sharing of ICT technologies among agencies is often the most cost-effective method of providing the highest quality and most timely governmental services that would otherwise be cost prohibitive. \n     F.     Considerations of both cost and the need for the transfer of information among the various departments in the most timely and useful form possible require a uniform policy and coordinated system for the use and acquisition of ICT technologies. \n     G.     It is the policy of the City to coordinate and direct the use of ICT technologies by City Departments and to provide the most cost-effective and useful retrieval and exchange of information both within and among City Departments and from City Departments to the people of San Francisco. \n(Added by Ord. 169-10, File No. 100095, App. 7/23/2010)\n\n","heading":{"title":"22A","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"22A.1","catch_text":"FINDINGS."}}
