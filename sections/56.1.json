{"text":"\n     The Board of Supervisors (\"Board\") concurs with the State Legislature in finding that: \n     (a)     The lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in a waste of resources, escalate the cost of housing and other development to the consumer, and discourage investment in and commitment to comprehensive planning and development of infrastructure and public facilities which would make maximum efficient utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public. \n     (b)     Assurance to the applicant/developer for a development project that upon approval of the project, the applicant/developer may proceed with the project in accordance with specified policies, rules and regulations, and subject to conditions of approval, will strengthen the public planning process, encourage private participation in comprehensive planning, and reduce the economic costs of development. \n(Added by Ord. 372-88, App. 8/10/88)\n\n","heading":{"title":"56","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"56.1","catch_text":"FINDINGS."}}
