{"text":"\n     (a)     Appointing officers are responsible for approving vacation schedules. In approving vacation schedules, the appointing officers shall give due regard to employee seniority and preference and the needs of the service. Unless an emergency situation exists requiring the immediate presence of an employee, an employee shall be allowed to begin a vacation on the day immediately following the employee's normal day off. \n     (b)     With the approval of the appointing officer, an employee's vacation allowance may be taken in increments of not less than one hour. \n     (c)     Except as requested by the employee to supplement disability benefits, the vacation allowance of an employee, who has started a vacation and who suffers a nonindustrial injury or illness or a recurrence of an industrial injury or illness during such vacation and who is entitled to and receives temporary disability benefits, shall not be charged for periods in which the employee receives disability benefits. \n     (d)     Every department shall maintain records which shall include, in addition to all other information required by the Civil Service Commission and Controller, the employee's accrued vacation allowance. When an employee accepts a permanent appointment to another department, the employee's vacation and sick leave records shall be transferred by the first department to the second department. Ninety calendar days after an automated payroll/personnel data system is fully implemented in a department, and, upon approval of the General Manager, Personnel, and the Controller, the maintenance of such records by the department shall no longer be required. All records shall, however, continue to be preserved according to present statutory requirements. \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85)\n\n","heading":{"title":"16","chaptersection":"14. ","identifier":"16.14. ","catch_text":"VACATION SCHEDULES."}}
