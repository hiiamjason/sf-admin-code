{"text":"\n\nSEC. 1.57-1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n     (a)     The Board of Supervisors finds and declares that a large, untapped reservoir of talent exists among the residents of the City and County of San Francisco, and that many San Franciscans are unaware of the opportunities to participate in, and serve on, city boards, commissions, taskforces and committees. The vast diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives among the citizenry of San Francisco would contribute significantly to the development and administration of local government. \n     (b)     The Board further finds and declares that the general public of San Francisco has traditionally been denied access to specific and current information regarding vacancies on such boards, commissions, task forces and committees. As a result, the City is denying many residents and interest groups the opportunity to be considered by the Appointing Authorities. Further, the respective Appointive Authorities have not been able to take advantage of a largely untapped talent resource. It is therefore the intent of the Board of Supervisors that this Section shall apply to all appointments made by all Appointing Authorities in the City and County of San Francisco. \n     (c)     The Board further finds and declares that all citizens of the City and County should have equal access to specific and current information about the many opportunities for appointment to city boards, commissions, taskforces and committees. An online database, publicly accessible via a universally accessible website, can provide the greatest level of access to up-to-date information to the most citizens of the City and County of San Francisco. Therefore, this Section shall provide for the establishment and maintenance of a centralized and publicly accessible online database of information concerning all appointments to all City and County of San Francisco boards, commissions, task forces, or committees by any Appointing Authority. \n(Added by Ord. 265-10, File No. 101008, App. 11/5/2010)\n\nSEC. 1.57-2.  DEFINITIONS.\n     For the purposes of this Section, certain terms are defined as follows: \n     (a)     \"Appointing Authority\" means the Mayor, the Board of Supervisors, the District Attorney, the Public Defender, and any other city officer authorized to make appointments to any city boards, commissions, task forces or committees, other than passive meeting bodies. \n     (b)     \"Advisory Body\" means all City and County of San Francisco boards, commissions, task forces and committees with one or more appointed seats. \n     (c)     \"Department Liaison\" means any advisory body's secretary or staff designee.\n     (d)     \"Appointments\" means all appointments to advisory bodies made by an Appointing Authority.\n     (e)     \"Centralized\" means a single database containing all required information.\n     (f)     \"Publicly accessible\" means universally accessible and open for use by the general public.\n     (g)     \"Online database\" means a catalogue of all appointments information, stored online, and publicly accessible via a website.
