All work performed in the geographic boundaries of the City by a Grantee, including work not involving excavation and including work performed on both public and private property, shall be performed in compliance with this Chapter, the Franchise, and other Applicable Law, including, but not limited to the City's Municipal Code, (including the Public Works Code), and CPUC General Orders 95, 112, and 128. Grantee shall, at its sole expense, procure and maintain in force at all times during the term of its Franchise any and all business and other licenses or approvals necessary to construct Facilities and provide any Services in the City. Grantee shall obtain any necessary approvals regarding the impact that its Facilities may have upon the environment. Nothing in this Chapter or in any Franchise is intended to imply that such approvals will be issued. \n     (b)     Construction, Operation, and Maintenance Standards. Experienced and properly trained maintenance and construction personnel shall perform the construction, operation and maintenance of Facilities in a manner consistent with industry standards and good engineering practices. In the event of a conflict among codes and standards, the most stringent applicable code or standard shall apply, except insofar as that standard, if followed, would result in Facilities that could not meet requirements of Applicable Law. A Grantee shall at all times employ reasonable care, within the meaning of Applicable Law, and shall install and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices to prevent failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public. \n(Added by Ord. 58-00, File No. 000198, App. 4/7/2000)\n\n","heading":{"title":"11","chaptersection":"29","identifier":"11.29","catch_text":"COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS."}}
