{"text":"\n     (a)     San Francisco Charter \nArticle XVII, defines \"Notice\" to mean publication (as defined by ordinance), and a contemporaneous filing with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors or other appropriate office. Charter \nArticle XVII further empowers the Board of Supervisors by ordinance to define the term \"Published\" and requires the Board of Supervisors to seek a recommendation from the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors before adopting such an ordinance. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors participated in the drafting of this ordinance. \n     (b)     The City has greatly expanded its use of electronic media to provide information to the public, and individuals' access to those media has also expanded greatly. In adopting this Article XII the Board of Supervisors intends to: (1) maximize use of electronic media as a cost effective means of publishing notices; (2) provide uniform implementation of Charter \nArticle XVII's \"publication\" requirement to the extent that implementation of this \nArticle XII does not conflict with notice or publication requirements specifically imposed by federal or State law or by the San Francisco Charter or applicable City ordinances; (3) provide City agencies with a standard notice and publication procedure that future City legislation can incorporate; and (4) establish a mechanism to ensure that drafters of all future legislation that addresses publication and notice consider the use of this standard notice and publication procedure. \n(Added by Ord. 318-10, File No. 101191, App. 12/21/2010)\n\n","heading":{"title":"2","chaptersection":"96","identifier":"2.96","catch_text":"FINDINGS."}}
