Such certification shall be based on a written report by a citing department containing the following information: the estimate for the abatement work; the amount of monies available from the Health Code \nArticle 11 abatement fund (\"Payment of Property Owner's Delinquencies for Abatement and Removal of Nuisances\"); those monies which are likely to be made available from the Health Code \nArticle 11 abatement fund within the next month; and, the amount of money likely to be collected from rental deposits by tenants into REAP accounts pending completion of the anticipated abatement work. The Director-DPH shall make his or her decision to utilize the REAP at a particular building based on the information contained in this report and on any other factors which are reasonable under the circumstances. \n     The Director-DPH shall notify all affected tenants by mail of the utilization of REAP, including an explanation of how rental payments may be deposited into the account. A record of all deposits made by tenants shall be maintained by the Director-DPH.
