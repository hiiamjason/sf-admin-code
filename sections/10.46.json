To enable the public to find all City reserve policies in one place, this ordinance includes a summary of the Charter-mandated Rainy Day Reserve. This summary is intended only for convenience and does not modify or supersede the Charter provisions. \n          The City maintains a \"Rainy Day\" or economic stabilization reserve under Charter Section \n9.113.5. In any year when the Controller projects that total General Fund revenues for the upcoming budget year are going to be more than 5 percent higher than the General Fund revenues for the current year, the City automatically deposits one-half of the \"excess revenues,\" meaning the revenues above and beyond the current year plus 5 percent growth, in the Rainy Day Reserve. The total amount of money in the Rainy Day Reserve may not exceed 10 percent of the City's actual total General Fund revenues. \n          The City may spend money from the Rainy Day Reserve for any lawful governmental purpose, but only in years when the Controller projects that total General Fund revenues for the upcoming year will be less than the current year's total General Fund revenues, i.e., years when the City expects to take in less money than it had taken in for the current year. In those years, the City may spend up to half the money in the Rainy Day Reserve, but no more than is necessary to bring the City's total available General Fund revenues up to the level of the current year. The City may also spend up to 25 percent of the balance of the Rainy Day Reserve to help the School District in years when certain conditions are met. \n     (b)     General Reserve. In addition to the Rainy Day Reserve, the City budget shall include a General Reserve. The General Reserve is intended to address revenue weaknesses, expenditure overages, or other programmatic goals not anticipated during the annual budget process. The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors may, at any time following adoption of the annual budget, appropriate monies from the General Reserve for any lawful governmental purpose through passage of a supplemental appropriation ordinance by a simple majority vote. \n          For purposes of this Section, \"regular General Fund revenues\" shall mean total General Fund sources less budgeted fund balances, budgeted uses of reserves, and net transfers, as determined by the Controller. The City shall fund the General Reserve at no less than two percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues no later than fiscal year 2016-2017 according to the following schedule: \n          1.     The General Reserve shall be no less than $25 million in the budget for fiscal year 2010-11;\n          2.     The General Reserve shall be no less than $25 million in the budget for fiscal year 2011-12;\n          3.     The General Reserve shall be no less than 1.0 percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues in fiscal year 2012-13;\n          4.     The General Reserve shall be no less than 1.25 percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues in the budget for fiscal year 2013-14; \n          5.     The General Reserve shall be no less than 1.5 percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues in the budget for fiscal year 2014-15; \n          6.     The General Reserve shall be no less than 1.75 percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues in the budget for fiscal year 2015-16; and, \n          7.     The General Reserve shall be no less than 2.0 percent of budgeted regular General Fund revenues in the budget for fiscal year 2016-17 and in the budget for each fiscal year thereafter. \n          Year-end balances in the General Reserve shall be carried forward to subsequent years. When necessary, the City shall appropriate sufficient funds to the General Reserve in the Annual Appropriation Ordinance to restore the fund balance to the level this ordinance requires. \n     (c)     Budget Stabilization Reserve. The City shall establish a Budget Stabilization Reserve to augment the Rainy Day Reserve that the City maintains under Charter Section \n9.113.5, and to further mitigate the negative effects of significant economic downturns. The Controller shall deposit funds to the Budget Stabilization Reserve as required under this Section. \n          The City may withdraw funds from the Budget Stabilization Reserve when the Controller projects that budgeted regular General Fund revenues for the upcoming budget year will be less than the current year's regular General Fund revenues, or less than the highest of any of the prior four fiscal years' regular General Fund revenues plus two percent, for each intervening year. If the Controller determines that either condition is met, the City may withdraw funds from the Budget Stabilization Reserve according to the following guidelines: \n          1.     The City may not withdraw funds from the Budget Stabilization Reserve in any given year until it has withdrawn the maximum amount that the Controller determines is allowable from the Rainy Day Reserve. \n          2.     The City may not withdraw funds from the Budget Stabilization Reserve in any given year in an amount exceeding the remaining shortfall in General Fund regular revenues, as defined above, after any withdrawals from the Rainy Day Reserve for the benefit of the City. \n          3.     If the Controller determines that a withdrawal trigger for the Budget Stabilization Reserve was not met in the current fiscal year, but projects that it will be met for the upcoming fiscal year, the City may withdraw from the Budget Stabilization Reserve up to 30 percent of the combined value of the Budget Stabilization Reserve and Rainy Day Reserve less monies withdrawn from the Rainy Day Reserve for any lawful governmental purpose in the upcoming budget year. \n          4.     If the Controller determines that a withdrawal trigger for the Budget Stabilization Reserve was met in the current fiscal year and projects that it will also be met for the upcoming fiscal year, the City may withdraw from the Budget Stabilization Reserve up to 50 percent of the combined value of the Budget Stabilization Reserve and Rainy Day Reserve less monies withdrawn from the Rainy Day Reserve for any lawful governmental purpose in the upcoming budget year. \n          5.     If the Controller determines that the withdrawal trigger for the Budget Stabilization Reserve was met in the current and prior fiscal year as well as the upcoming fiscal year, the Board may withdraw up to the full balance of the Budget Stabilization Reserve for any lawful governmental purpose in the upcoming budget year. \n          In order to fund the Budget Stabilization Reserve, the Controller shall deposit 75 percent of the following revenue sources to the Budget Stabilization Reserve: \n          1.     Real Property Transfer Tax proceeds in excess of the average annual actual receipts level for the prior five fiscal years, adjusted for any transfer tax rate increases adopted by the voters during the prior five year period; and \n          2.     Ending unassigned General Fund balances in a given fiscal year as reported in the City's most recent independent annual audit beyond those appropriated as a source in the subsequent year's budget. \n          At the conclusion of the fiscal year, the Controller shall revise, if necessary, the balance in the Budget Stabilization Reserve to reflect year-end actual revenue receipts, as stated in the City's most recent independent annual audit. \n          There shall be no minimum fund balance for the Budget Stabilization Reserve. Notwithstanding the above, the Controller shall not make deposit to the Budget Stabilization Reserve, including deposits from the revenue sources identified above, if the combined fund balances of the Budget Stabilization Reserve and the Rainy Day Reserve equal or exceed 10 percent of actual regular General Fund revenues, as stated in the City's most recent independent annual audit. \n          The Controller shall not make deposits to the Budget Stabilization Reserve in years in which the Controller determines that the City is eligible to make withdrawals from the Budget Stabilization Reserve. \n          In the event that monies are deposited into the Rainy Day Reserve for any given year, any amount which would otherwise be deposited into the Budget Stabilization Reserve shall be reduced by the amount of the deposit to the Rainy Day Reserve. \n          The City, by a resolution of the Board of Supervisors adopted by a two-thirds' vote, may temporarily suspend the provisions of this subsection (c) for the current or upcoming budget year. The Board of Supervisors may suspend these provisions following a natural disaster that has caused the Mayor or the Governor to declare an emergency, or for any other purpose. \n     (d)     Annual Reporting on Reserves. The Controller shall submit to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors an annual report on the status of the General Reserve, the Rainy Day Reserve, and the Budget Stabilization Reserve. \n(Added by Ord. 91-10, File No. 100248, App. 4/30/2010; amended by Ord. 235-11, File No. 110999, App. 12/1/2011, Eff. 12/31/2011, Oper. 6/1/2012)\n\nSEC. 10.61.  USE OF SELECTED NONRECURRING REVENUES.\n     (a)     Nonrecurring Revenues. For purposes of this Section, \"Selected Nonrecurring Revenues\" shall mean:\n          (1)     A General Fund prior year-end unassigned fund balance, before deposits to the Rainy Day Reserve or Budget Stabilization Reserve, in excess of the average of the preceding five years;\n          (2)     The General Fund share of revenues from prepayments provided under long-term leases, concessions, or contracts after accounting for any Charter-mandated revenue transfers, set-asides, or deposits to reserves;\n          (3)     Otherwise unrestricted revenues from legal judgments and settlements; and,\n          (4)     Otherwise unrestricted revenues from the sale of land or other fixed assets.\n     (b)     Nonrecurring Expenditures. The City may only spend Selected Nonrecurring Revenues on Nonrecurring Expenditures. For purposes of this Section, \"Nonrecurring Expenditures\" shall mean expenditures or other uses that do not create liability for or expectation of substantial ongoing costs, including, but not limited to:\n          (1)     Discretionary funding of reserves;\n          (2)     Acquisition of capital equipment;\n          (3)     Capital projects included in the City's capital plans;\n          (4)     Development of affordable housing;\n          (5)     Discretionary prepayment of pension, debt, or other long term obligations. Provided, however, that the City may appropriate Selected Nonrecurring Revenues to fund recurring expenditures, such as operating expenses for a program or routine maintenance for a facility, through an ordinance approved by the Mayor and passed by a two-thirds' vote of the Board of Supervisors; or,\n          (6)     Substitution for budgeted reserves when new revenues disallow previously budgeted withdrawals from the Rainy Day Reserve or Budget Stabilization Reserve.\n          Upon the request of the Mayor or a member of the Board of Supervisors, the Controller shall certify whether the proposed use of a Selected Nonrecurring Revenue would be a Nonrecurring Expenditure, and his or her determination shall be final.\n     (c)     Implementation. The Mayor shall identify all Selected Nonrecurring Revenues and their proposed uses in his or her June 1 budget submission. As part of the Controller's Opinion on Revenue Estimates required under Charter Section \n9.102, the Controller shall identify all Selected Nonrecurring Revenues included in the Mayor's budget submission and certify whether the proposed uses of those revenues constitute Nonrecurring Expenditures.\n     (d)     Temporary Suspension. The City, by a resolution of the Board of Supervisors adopted by a two-thirds' vote, may temporarily suspend the provisions of subsection (b) for the current or upcoming budget year. The Board of Supervisors may suspend these provisions following a natural disaster that has caused the Mayor or the Governor to declare an emergency, or for any other purpose.\n(Added by Ord. 235-11, File No. 110999, App. 12/1/2011, Eff. 12/31/2011, Oper. 6/1/2012)\n\nSEC. 10.62.  CERTIFICATES OF PARTICIPATION; COMMERCIAL PAPER.\n     (a)     This Policy shall govern the authorization of Certificates of Participation (\"COPs\") that may be caused to be executed and delivered by the City in connection with the financing of capital projects payable and secured by the City's General Fund. This Policy also governs the issuance of commercial paper from time to time by the Controller's Office of Public Finance. This Policy supplements the Controller's Office of Public Finance's Debt Policy of the City and County of San Francisco (\"Debt Policy\"), which document is on file for informational purposes with the Clerk of the Board.\n     (b)     Certificates of Participation.\n          (1)     The City may cause the execution and delivery of COPs for, without limitation, (i) the acquisition or improvement of existing facilities and/or construction of new facilities that result in immediate or future savings in payments currently made or to be made by the City's General Fund, (ii) to leverage grant and other monies to reduce operating costs of the City, (iii) for the construction, improvement or acquisition of facilities to address legal mandates or (iv) the construction, improvement or acquisition of facilities for critical public health and safety needs. Notwithstanding anything contained in this ordinance, COPs may not be authorized to finance annual operating costs of the City.\n          (2)     The Controller and Director of Public Finance shall identify specific revenue sources within the General Fund (e.g., transient occupancy taxes, tobacco settlement receipts, etc.) as internal repayment sources for COPs, to ensure that prudent repayment schedules are placed on the General Fund.\n          (3)     The Board of Supervisors may authorize the issuance of COPs and other lease financing debt as funding sources for capital projects provided the annual debt service cost of such outstanding indebtedness does not exceed 3.25 percent of discretionary revenue, as determined by the Controller and the Director of Public Finance. For the purposes of this subsection, \"discretionary revenue\" shall be determined by the Controller in a manner consistent with the calculation of aggregate City and County discretionary revenue under Charter Sections \n8A.105 and \n16.109, and this calculation shall be included in the staff report requesting approval of any COPs financing.\n          (4)     For purposes of subsection (3), the 3.25 percent of discretionary revenue limitation excludes lease-financed projects that result in decreases in costs supported by discretionary General Fund revenues, calculated on a net present value basis by the Controller and Director of Public Finance, and any portion of lease-financing obligations payable from (i) non-General Fund revenue sources, (ii) grants, or (iii) state and/or federal reimbursement.\n     (c)     Commercial Paper Program.\n          (1)     The Director of Public Finance may issue tax-exempt and taxable commercial paper notes to provide interim funds to finance the acquisition, construction, and rehabilitation of capital improvements and capital equipment. Commercial paper notes shall not be issued for any project unless that project and financing plan therefor shall have received prior approval from the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor.\n          (2)     The Director of Public Finance shall provide a written report to the Board of Supervisors twelve months following the initial issuance of commercial paper notes and annually thereafter until no commercial paper note remain outstanding describing (i) the notes issued since commencement of the Commercial Paper Program and since the date of the last report; (ii) summarizing the current status of projects financed with commercial paper; and (iii) identifying the long term plan of finance with respect to any general obligation bonds, COPs or other long term obligation to refund such commercial paper notes.\n     (d)     Exceptions from the Policy.\n          (1)     The Board of Supervisors, by a resolution adopted by a two-thirds' vote, may temporarily suspend the provisions of this Section \n10.62 for the current or upcoming budget year, and may suspend its provisions for individual transactions. The Board of Supervisors may suspend these provisions following a natural disaster that has caused the Mayor or the Governor to declare an emergency, or for any other purpose.\n          (2)     The failure of the City to comply with any provision of this Policy shall not affect the authorization or the validity or enforceability of any COPs or other long term obligation that are otherwise issued in accordance with law.\n          (3)     The Policy shall only apply to indebtedness secured by the City's General Fund and does not apply to other departments or enterprises of the City, including the Airport Commission, the Mayor's Office of Housing, the Municipal Transportation Authority, the Port Commission, or the Public Utilities Commission.\n(Added by Ord. 221-11, File No. 111000, App. 11/15/2011, Eff. 12/15/2011, Oper. 7/1/2012)\n\nARTICLE XI:\nNUMBERING OF LOTS AND BLOCKS FOR ASSESSMENT PURPOSES \n\n\nSec. 10.70.\nFormulation of System of Numbering Lots and Blocks; Preparation of Maps. \n\nSec. 10.71.\nLot and Block Numbers to be Written on Assessment Rolls. \n\nSec. 10.72.\nChanges in Map and Block Books. \n\nSec. 10.73.\nFiling of Copies of Block Books. \n\nSEC. 10.70.  FORMULATION OF SYSTEM OF NUMBERING LOTS AND BLOCKS; PREPARATION OF MAPS.\n     The City and County Assessor-Recorder and the City Engineer are hereby authorized to prepare and formulate a system of assessing the lots and blocks and lands in the City and County by a lot number and block number.

The Legislature has adopted a statute (Chapter 1331, Statutes of 1989) implementing the provisions of the Tobacco Tax and Health Protection Act of 1988 (the \"Tobacco Tax Initiative\"). The statute allocates funds received from the Tobacco Tax Initiative. A portion of these funds is allocated for two purposes: (1) to reimburse physicians for losses incurred in providing certain services to unsponsored patients unable to pay for them (Physicians Services Account) and (2) for payment or support of services provided by non-County hospitals (the non-County portion of the Hospital Services Account) (Section 9, Chapter 1331, Stats. 1989; Welfare and Institutions Code Sections 16940 and 16950\n          The Board of Supervisors adopts this ordinance in order to establish procedures for the filing of claims by physicians and hospitals for reimbursement from these funds, the payment of claims to eligible parties, and the recoupment of any funds erroneously paid. \n          It is the intent of the Board that the provisions of this ordinance be consistent with the provisions of Chapter 1331, Stats. 1989, as currently enacted or as hereafter amended, and the County Health Services Plan and Budget developed by the County. If Chapter 1331 is hereafter amended to further regulate the Physician Services Account or the non-County portion of the Hospital Services Account, this ordinance shall be deemed to have incorporated those amendments. \n     (b)     Administering Agency. Pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code Section 16952(e), the San Francisco Department of Public Health is designated the administering agency responsible for implementing Chapter 5, Part 4.7 (commencing with Section 16900) of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. \n     (c)     Establishment of Procedures. The Department of Public Health shall establish a procedure for the submission and processing of claims from physicians and hospitals eligible to receive funds from the Physician Services Account and the non-County portion of the Hospital Services Account. The procedure may include the use of a contractor to process claims and to otherwise implement the provisions of Chapter 1331 relating to the Physician Services Account and the non-County portion of the Hospital Services Account. \n     (d)     Physician Services Account Claims.\n          (1)     Eligible Claimants. Funds from the Physician Services Account shall be used to pay claims submitted by physicians who have incurred losses due to the rendering of emergency, obstetric and pediatric services to patients unable to pay for the services who are not eligible for Medi-Cal, Medicare, private insurance, or any other federal, state, or County program which provides reimbursement for physician services. Services provided by physicians employed by County hospitals or services provided in a primary care clinic are not eligible for 'reimbursement pursuant to this Section. \n          (2)     Requirements for Reimbursement. The Department of Public Health shall only reimburse physicians when the following conditions have been met: \n               (A)     The physician has inquired if there is a responsible third-party source of payment;\n               (B)     The physician has billed for payment of services;\n               (C)     A period of not less than six months has passed from the date the physician billed the patient or responsible third party, during which time the physician has made reasonable efforts to obtain reimbursement and has not received reimbursement for any portion of the amount billed; and \n               (D)     The physician has stopped any current, and waives any future, collection efforts to obtain reimbursement from the patient.\n          (3)     Reimbursement Limited. No physician shall be reimbursed for more than 50 percent of the losses submitted. \n          (4)     Claimants to Keep Records. Any physician who submits a claim pursuant to this Section shall keep and maintain records of the services rendered, the person to whom services were rendered, and any additional information the administering agency may require, for a period of three years after the services were provided. \n     (e)     Hospital Services Account.\n          (1)     Eligible Claimants. Funds from the non-County portion of the Hospital Services Account shall be used in part to pay claims submitted by non-County hospitals for the provision of uncompensated services to patients unable to pay for the services who are not eligible for Medi-Cal, Medicare, private insurance, or any other federal, state, or County program which provides reimbursement for physician services. \n          (2)     Reimbursement Formula. Funds shall be distributed as provided in the County Health Services Plan and Budget. \n          (3)     Requirements for Reimbursement. A hospital may receive funds from the Hospital Services Account only if it agrees to comply with the following requirements: \n               (A)     Maintain the same number and designation of emergency rooms and trauma care permits as existed on the effective date of Chapter 1333, Stats. 1989; \n               (B)     Provide data and reports on the use and expenditure of all funds received in a form and according to procedures specified by the Department of Public Health and the State Department of Health Services; and \n               (C)     Assure that funds received pursuant to this Section are used only for uncompensated services for persons eligible pursuant to this Section. \n     (f)     Demographic Data; Indemnification; Audits; Evaluative Studies.\n          (1)     Demographic Data. In order to qualify for reimbursement, claimant physicians and hospitals shall agree to provide the demographic data and any other information required by State law implementing the Tobacco Tax Initiative. \n          (2)     Indemnification.

Housing linked with services, \"supportive\" or \"service-enriched\" housing, has become widely recognized as an ideal model for addressing the problem of homelessness. This model recognizes that low-income people often have multiple unmet needs, including a need for both safe affordable housing and readily available support services to effectively stabilize their lives. There are opportunities to leverage federal, state and other funds to expand and improve our supportive housing stock. However, the requirements for integrated service programs and local matching funds demand timely access and coordinated support from a single City source, which has heretofore been unavailable. \n     (b)     Statement of Intent. The Board of Supervisors wishes to address the above concerns by establishing a supportive services fund which will both facilitate the development of newly constructed or rehabilitated affordable supportive housing and ensure that a portion of the existing affordable housing in San Francisco is accessible and appropriate to those with service needs which put them at risk of repeated homelessness and hinder them from participating fully in the community. For purposes of this ordinance \"affordable housing\" shall mean housing affordable to low and moderate income households as defined by California Health and Safety Code Sections 50052.5, et seq. Such affordability shall be maintained for a period of not less than the greater of fifty years or the life of the project. \n     (c)     Establishment of Fund. The Mayor's Supportive Housing Service Fund is established as a category eight fund for the purpose of providing financial assistance to the owners of for-profit and nonprofit affordable housing developments, where the contribution of monies from the fund will provide necessary supportive services to the residents of these affordable housing developments. Said fund shall be known as the Supportive Housing Service Fund. Subject to any prior legally binding obligations, any grants, gifts or bequests from private or public sources for this purpose and any monies appropriated to the fund shall be deposited into said special fund. \n     (d)     Use of Fund. Monies deposited in the fund shall be expended exclusively in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to Subsection (e), below. The supportive housing services for which expenditures may be made by this fund are mental health services, services for people with HIV/AIDS, services for seniors, social work/case management services, substance abuse services, vocational services, child care, and community development services (such as establishing tenant councils or facilitating peer support groups). The services must be for the direct benefit of and easily accessible to the residents of low and moderate income housing developments. \n     (e)     Exceptions to Fund Category. The Executive Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing, or his or her designee, shall administer expenditures from the fund, subject to the rules and regulations established through the process described in (f).

Such rules and regulations shall include, but not be limited to the qualifications of applicants and factors to be considered in the award of grants to fund supportive housing services. Such rules and regulations shall be designed to ensure that although the highest priority use is established for supportive services at proposed new affordable housing developments, that monies from this fund may also be expended for supportive services at existing affordable housing developments. The rules and regulations shall be subject to a public hearing and approved by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. \n          The Supportive Housing Services Fund Committee shall consist of those officials currently serving as members of the Affordable Housing Loan Committee (the Executive Director of the Redevelopment Agency, the Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing and the Mayor's Homeless Coordinator, or any respective successors responsible for housing and homeless services as designated by the Mayor), a representative from the Department of Social Services and a representative from the Department of Public Health who shall be appointed by the respective department head in consultation with the Mayor.

If, as a condition of the grant, the City is required to provide any matching funds, those funds shall be included in determining whether the grant meets the $100,000 threshold. This subsection shall also apply to an increase in a grant where the increase, alone or in combination with any other previous increases to that grant, would raise the cumulative total amount of the grant to $100,000 or more. The department, board, or commission requesting approval shall submit the following documents to the Board prior to its consideration:\n          (1)     A proposed resolution approving the acceptance and expenditure of grant funds, or a proposed ordinance as required under subsection (b),\n1 signed by the department head, the Mayor or his or her designee, and the Controller; \n          (2)     A completed \"Grant Information Form.\" The Clerk of the Board shall prepare the form; it shall include a disability access checklist, indirect cost recovery, and other information as the Board of Supervisors may require; \n          (3)     A copy of the grant application;\n          (4)     A letter of intent to award the grant or acknowledgment of grant award from the granting agency; and,\n          (5)     A cover letter to the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors substantially conforming to the specifications of the Clerk of the Board.\n     (c)     Grants or Increases to Grants of Less Than $100,000. The Controller may prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of federal, State, or other grant funds in amounts less than $100,000, or for increases to grants where the increase, alone or in combination with any other previous increases to that grant, would not raise the cumulative total amount of the grant to $100,000 or more. The Controller may also prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of increases to grants, where the original grant or any subsequent increase to the grant has been approved by the Board of Supervisors under subsection (b) or (d) and where the latest increase would be in an amount less than $50,000.\n     (d)     Grant Funded Positions. No position funded by a grant, regardless of the amount of the grant, shall be authorized or filled unless the classification, duration, and number of positions to be funded by the grant are specifically set forth in an ordinance approving acceptance and expenditure, which ordinance shall also contain appropriate amendments to the annual salary ordinance to reflect the positions proposed to be funded through the grant. \n     (e)     Recurring Grants.

Every grant shall contain provisions for the reimbursement of indirect costs.

The provisions of this Section shall not be applicable to applications for or expenditure of funds from the San Francisco County Transportation Authority. The Controller shall prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of such funds. \n     (k)     Certain Transportation Funds (Proposition 1B Funds). The voters of California adopted Proposition 1B, the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006, at the November 7, 2006 California General Election. Under the Proposition, the State will appropriate two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) into the Local Streets and Road Improvement, Congestion Relief, and Traffic Safety Account of 2006 (\"Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds\"). These funds will be distributed to cities and counties for improvements to transportation facilities that will assist in reducing local traffic congestion and further deterioration, improving traffic flows, or increasing traffic safety that may include, but not be limited to, street and highway pavement, maintenance, rehabilitation, installation, construction and reconstruction of necessary associated facilities such as drainage and traffic control devices, or the maintenance, rehabilitation, installation, construction and reconstruction of facilities that expand ridership on transit systems, safety projects to reduce fatalities, or as a local match to obtain state or federal transportation funds for similar purposes. The Proposition requires that the funds distributed to the City be deposited in a local account that is designated for the receipt of state funds allocated for local streets and roads. \n          (1)     The Board of Supervisors finds that while there are a range of projects involving various City departments that could benefit from the Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, implementing a coordinated planning process for use of those funds will help ensure the effective and efficient expenditure of funds in a manner that will maximize the benefit to the City and its residents. \n          (2)     The Board of Supervisors further finds that given the range of projects and the Citywide impact of transportation-related projects, it is appropriate for the Board to review proposed expenditures of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, and to be kept apprised of the progress on projects that are receiving Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds. \n          (3)     The Board of Supervisors shall not to appropriate any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, as referenced above, until the Board has received from the department or departments requesting the appropriations a specific and detailed spending plan for the funds. The Spending Plan (the \"Plan\") shall set forth projects, programs and other improvements to be funded over the next ten years (10) years by Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, and shall include a budget, scope, and schedule, as well as any other information requested by the Board. The Plan should also address the relative need or urgency, cost effectiveness, and fair geographic distribution of resources, taking into account the various needs of San Francisco's neighborhoods. The Plan shall be coordinated with other relevant City agencies including the Planning Department and the Municipal Transportation Agency, as well as the San Francisco Transportation Authority. The Plan should identify attempts to leverage or match Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds with funding from other sources, including any other state or federal funds. No City Department shall expend or encumber any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds without approval from the Board of Supervisors pursuant to this ordinance. Any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds received by the City and County of San Francisco will be deposited into a local account named \"The Proposition 1B Local Account,\" and shall remain in such account until the Board of Supervisors approves a department's specific spending plan. Under no circumstances will Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds be mixed with other funds prior to the approval of the spending plans as outlined in this paragraph. Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds can be appropriated as part of the annual budget process only if the requirements of this paragraph are met. The Board of Supervisors further encourages any department seeking such an appropriation to consult and work with its commission if any, the public, and the Board on the development of such spending plans. \n          (4)     Any department that receives an appropriation of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds shall report back to the Board of Supervisors beginning six months from the date of the appropriation, and at six-month intervals thereafter until the appropriation has been spent. The report required by this Section shall state the amount of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds expended as of the reporting date and shall describe the progress on the project, the projected date of completion, and such additional information as the Board may require as a condition of the appropriation. \n          (5)     The Controller shall perform an audit every two years of all Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds that are allocated, whether expended or not, to determine what projects were actually funded. Any Department receiving Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds shall cooperate with the Controller's Office in the performance of the audit. \n(Added by Ord. 391-97, App. 10/17/97; amended by Ord. 230-06, File No. 060852, App. 9/14/2006; Ord. 102-07, File No. 070316, App. 5/4/2007; Ord. 97-12, File No. 120192, App. 5/29/2012, Eff. 6/28/2012)\nCODIFICATION NOTE\n\n1.     So in Ord. 97-12; the reference should be to division (d).\n\n2.     So in Ord. 97-12; the reference should be to division (b).\n\nSEC. 10.170-2.  ACCOUNTING FOR GRANTS; DUTIES OF CONTROLLER, OFFICERS, BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS.\n     Upon receipt of a federal, State or other grant, the officer, employer, board or commission authorized to file application therefor pursuant to the provisions of Section \n10.170 hereof, shall forthwith notify the Controller of such receipt.

The District Attorney is authorized to collect the Administrative Fee from persons who are determined by the District Attorney to be eligible for the Community Court Program and who elect to participate in the Program. The District Attorney shall explain the basis and amount of any fee to each person in advance of his or her participation in the Community Court Program.

Consistent with the Dispute Resolution Program Act (California Business and Professions Code section 465 et seq. and implementing regulations at 16 California Administrative Code section 3600 et seq.), the Administrative Fee shall be assessed on a sliding scale basis. Individuals whose income and resources fall below 60 percent of the Area Median Income for individuals shall pay no Administrative Fee. Individuals whose income and resources are at or above 60 percent of the Area Median Income for individuals shall pay $115.00 per case. A business participating in the Community Courts Program shall pay $165.00 per case.

No agency providing dispute resolution services through the Community Court Program may collect any additional administrative fees from participants in the Community Courts Program. \n     (e)     Use of Fee.

The District Attorney is authorized to collect an administrative fee from persons arrested for violating Penal Code Section 647(b) who are determined by the District Attorney to be eligible for the District Attorney's First Offender Prostitution Program and who elect to participate in the program. \n     (b)     Fee Amount. The fee authorized by Subsection (a) shall be set by the District Attorney to cover the cost of administering the First Offender Prostitution Program but shall not exceed $500. The District Attorney may establish reduced fee rates for individuals who lack the financial capability to pay the full fee. In no event shall the reduced fee be less than $100 for any individual participant. \n     (c)     Fee Modification. The District Attorney shall examine the fee annually to ensure that it continues to reflect the costs of the services provided by the program.

All other revenues are special revenues and fall into special revenue funding. This ordinance makes a mutually exclusive distinction between the General Fund and Special Revenue Funds. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.195.  CONTROLLER'S DUTIES.\n     The San Francisco Controller (hereinafter referred to as the Controller) shall be charged with the responsibility for the administration of this Article. \n     The Controller shall prepare those budgetary procedures, regulations, reporting requirements and guidelines sufficient to enable him or her to determine for each service rendering agency the costs of its operation to the extent services are rendered or facilities provided to recipient agencies and, if not funded directly by recipient agencies, to allocate the cost of that operation on and amongst recipient agencies to the extent that these recipient agencies are funded from Special Fund sources. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.196.  ANNUAL SURVEY.\n     The Controller shall on an annual basis conduct a survey to determine which San Francisco agencies render services or provide facilities to (other San Francisco) non General Fund agencies and how much in terms of services and facilities are provided on an annual basis by each service rendering agency to each recipient agency. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.197.  COMPUTATION OF GENERAL SERVICE CHARGE.\n     Based on the aforementioned services, the Controller shall calculate the total cost of services rendered and facilities provided by all service rendering agencies to each recipient agency and, on a recipient agency by recipient agency basis, shall interpret that total cost into a specific percentage of each rendering agency's total annual expenditures. This percentage shall be known as the general service charge. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.198.  DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET ESTIMATES.\n     Each recipient agency as part of its annual budget estimate shall include in that estimate an allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund sufficient to defray the anticipated cost of services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by all rendering agencies, calculated on the basis of its general service charge prepared by the Controller. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80)\n\nSEC. 10.199.  CONTROLLER'S REVIEW.\n     The Controller shall on an annual basis, as part of his or her duties in reviewing budget estimates submitted to him or her and consolidated by him or her for transmission to the Mayor, verify that the annual budget for each recipient agency contains an allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund sufficient to fund the cost of services to be rendered and facilities to be provided by all rendering agencies. In those cases where the Controller determines that the recipient agency has failed in its budget estimate to make the allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund to defray the cost of rendering services or providing facilities to all service rendering agencies, calculated pursuant to its general service charge, the Controller shall make the appropriate allocation by reducing expenditures for other items in the budget estimates. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80; amended by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.199-1.\n(Amended by Ord. 59-83, App. 2/4/83; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.201.\n(Added by Ord. 58-82, App. 2/11/82; amended by Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.203.\n(Added by Ord. 342-87, App. 8/21/87; amended by Ord. 283-90, App. 7/24/90; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.204.\n(Added by Ord. 416-93, App. 12/23/93; amended by Ord. 79-96, App. 2/23/96; Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.205.\n(Added by Ord. 376-96, App. 9/30/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nARTICLE XIX:\n[RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE XX:\nLIEN PROCEDURE \n\n\nSec. 10.230.\nApplicability.\n\nSec. 10.230A.\nRequest for Payment; Notice of Delinquent Account and Proposed Lien; Authorization for Lien.\n\nSec. 10.231.\nReport to Board of Supervisors.\n\nSec. 10.232.\nNotice of Hearing.\n\nSec. 10.233.\nHearing.\n\nSec. 10.234.\nCreation of Lien.\n\nSec. 10.235.\nRecordation.\n\nSec. 10.236.\nFiling With Controller and Tax Collector; Distribution of Proceeds.\n\nSec. 10.237.\nRelease of Lien, Recording Fee. \n\nSEC. 10.230.  APPLICABILITY.\n     The following procedures are adopted pursuant to California Government Code Section 54988 and/or the Charter City Powers of City and County of San Francisco. Where an ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco authorizes the creation and imposition of a lien to enforce financial obligations owed to the City and County of San Francisco, the procedure set forth herein shall govern unless a different lien procedure is specifically provided for. If another ordinance of the City and County authorizes a different lien procedure which is subsequently declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the procedures set forth in this Article shall apply. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.230A.  REQUEST FOR PAYMENT; NOTICE OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNT AND PROPOSED LIEN; AUTHORIZATION FOR LIEN.\n     (a)     Prior to initiating proceedings under this Article for the imposition of a lien, the department seeking to collect the fee, charge or cost at issue shall mail the property owner a written request for payment. If the fee, charge or cost has not been paid within 30 calendar days of such notice, the department may initiate lien proceedings pursuant to this Article to recover the amount due. Where another ordinance authorizing a specific lien requires not less than 30 calendar days written notice to the property owner prior to the initiation of lien proceedings, that notice shall constitute compliance with this Subsection. \n     (b)     A department seeking to initiate lien proceedings shall, following the end of the 30 calendar day period set forth in subsection (a), send the property owner via certified mail a written notice of proposed lien that shall include information as to the amount due, instructions for payment, and the name and telephone number of a department official to contact for questions or further information. The notice shall further state that if the amount due is not paid within 45 days, it shall be considered a delinquent account subject to lien pursuant to this Article and that before the lien may be imposed, the property owner has the right to appear before the Board of Supervisors at a hearing regarding the amount due. The notice shall also state that if the obligation remains unpaid, administrative fees, penalties and interest (including interest on amounts due after they have become a lien and continuing until paid) pursuant to this Article will accrue and become part of the lien. \n     (c)     To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien does not provide for notice, or establishes lesser notice requirements, this section shall establish minimum notice requirements. To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien establishes greater or additional notice requirements, those notice requirements shall control. The provisions of this section are not intended to affect any notice requirements imposed by preemptive State or federal law. \n     (d)     A financial obligation that is subject to this Article, and which remains unpaid after 45 calendar days from the date of the notice required pursuant to subsection (b) shall be deemed a delinquent account. In accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article, the Board of Supervisors may ensure collection of a delinquent account by making the amount thereof, along with any administrative charges, penalties, fees and interest, a lien against the subject property. \n(Added by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.231.  REPORT TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.\n     Each head of a department or office shall report not less than annually to the Board of Supervisors on delinquent accounts as provided herein. The report to the Board of Supervisors shall contain the following information for each such delinquent account: \n     1.     The property owner's name;\n     2.     The purpose of the charge, the payment for which is overdue;\n     3.     The amount due, including penalty and interest;\n     4.     The amount of the unpaid balance, including penalty on the delinquent payment;\n     5.     A description of the parcel or property against which a lien may be assessed. The descriptions of the parcels shall be those used for the same parcels on the Assessor's map books for the current year; and \n     6.     A recommendation on whether the lien procedure is appropriate for such delinquent account; and if not, a detailed explanation of inappropriateness shall be included. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.232.  NOTICE OF HEARING.\n     Upon receipt of such report the Board shall fix a time, date and place for a hearing on the report and any protest or objections thereto, and shall cause notice of the hearing to be sent by certified mail to each owner of the property described in the report not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing. Such notice shall be mailed to the owner at the address maintained by the Tax Collector for the mailing of property tax bills. In addition, where the proposed lien would be entitled to greater force, effect and priority than that provided by law for a judgment lien, a copy of the notice shall be mailed to other persons who have a recorded interest in the property. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.233.  HEARING.\n     At the time fixed for the hearing on the report, the Board of Supervisors shall consider it along with any protests or objections of the owners of the properties liable to be assessed for delinquent accounts or other persons with a recorded interest in one or more of the properties. The Board may make such revisions, corrections or modifications of the report as it may deem necessary. In the event that the Board is satisfied with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified), it shall be confirmed by resolution. The decision of the Board on the report and on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, any delinquent account may be removed from the report by payment in full at any time prior to confirmation of the report. The Clerk of the Board shall cause the confirmed report to be verified in form sufficient to meet recording requirements. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.234.  CREATION OF LIEN.\n     Upon recordation of the confirmed report by the Board, the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute a lien against the property. \n     The lien shall continue until the lien value and all interest, fees and penalties due and payable thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ordinary municipal taxes shall be applicable to said lien, subject to two exceptions: (1) if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to the real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection; and (2) liens recorded pursuant to this Article shall only have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien unless State law confers a different priority. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.235.  RECORDATION.\n     The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall cause the confirmed and verified report to be recorded in the County Recorder's office. The lien on each parcel of property described in said report shall carry additional charges for administrative expenses of $50 or 10 percent of the amount owed, whichever is higher, together with interest at the rate of one percent per full month compounded monthly from the date of recordation of the lien on all charges due. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.236.  FILING WITH CONTROLLER AND TAX COLLECTOR; DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS.\n     The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall file a certified copy of each confirmed report with the Controller and Tax Collector within 10 days after confirmation of the report, whereupon it shall be the duty of said officers to add the amount of said lien to the next regular bill for taxes levied against said property for municipal purposes, and thereafter said amount shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City and County ad valorem real property taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for property taxes of the City and County of San Francisco, except that in conducting such a foreclosure and sale, the City shall have only the authority and priority that it is entitled to for enforcement of a judgment lien unless state law confers a different priority. \n     Except for the release of lien recording fee authorized in Section \n10.237, where the expenditure of City funds for which the lien is being imposed was made from departmental funds, all sums collected by the Tax Collector pursuant to this Article shall be allocated to the credit of the department for which the lien was imposed and to such other City departments as are administering collection of the lien for reimbursement of those expenses. Where the costs for which the lien is imposed have been paid from the General Fund instead of departmental funds, the sums collected shall be deposited in the General Fund, and not allocated to the department for which the lien was imposed. Unless otherwise authorized by law, the proceeds of the lien transferred to the department may be used only to fund the activities or undertakings the charge leading to the lien was designed to fund. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.237.  RELEASE OF LIEN, RECORDING FEE.\n     Upon payment to the Tax Collector of the lien amount plus applicable penalties, administrative fees and interest charges, the Tax Collector shall cause to be recorded a Release of Lien with the County Recorder, and from the sum collected pursuant to Section \n10.236, shall pay to the County Recorder a Release of Lien fee of $9.00. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\nCHAPTER 10A:\n[RESERVED]\nSEC. 10A.1.  RESERVED.\n(Added by Ord. 274-06, File No. 060700)\nEditor's Note:     Former Ch. 10A (\"Pilot Foot Patrol Program\") expired by operation of its sunset provision on 1/1/2008.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
