{"text":"\n     The Board of Supervisors hereby finds and declares that it is in the public interest to facilitate private contributions for the support of the arts in San Francisco. To the extent that members of the public can be encouraged to make donations to nonprofit arts organizations, the cultural quality of life in the City will be enhanced and the need to support such arts activities with public funds will be diminished. This Chapter is therefore enacted to facilitate the collection and distribution of donations from San Francisco residents and other interested members of the public for equipment acquisition, facilities maintenance and capital improvements. \n(Added by Ord. 79-84, App. 2/23/84)\n\n","heading":{"title":"51","chaptersection":"01","identifier":"51.01","catch_text":"PURPOSE AND FINDINGS."}}
