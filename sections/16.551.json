{"text":"\n     If a vacancy occurs, or will occur, in the office of an elected trustee prior to the date that the term of that office expires, the Retirement Board, Health Service Board or Retiree Health Trust Fund Board shall order a special election to fill the vacancy for the unexpired portion of the term of office, unless another election to a Retirement Board, Health Service Board or Retiree Health Trust Fund Board office is scheduled to be completed within six months after the vacancy has, or shall, occur, in which case the elections shall be combined; provided, however, that a separate special election shall be required if the election which has already been scheduled will occur too soon to nominate and select candidates for the more recent vacancy. Whenever the Retirement Board, Health Service Board or Retiree Health Trust Fund Board orders an election, the respective Board shall specify whether the election is to be conducted by the Department of Elections or by an unbiased independent contractor (\"Contractor\"). Special elections may be held on an expedited basis as determined by the Department of Elections. The first Retiree Health Trust Fund Board election shall be a special election conducted by the Department of Elections. \n(Added by Ord. 512-80, App. 10/29/80; amended by Ord. 287-94, App. 8/4/94; Ord. 378-95, App. 12/7/95; Ord. 285-08, File No. 081190, App. 12/5/2008) \n\n","heading":{"title":"16","chaptersection":"551. ","identifier":"16.551. ","catch_text":"RETIREMENT BOARD, HEALTH SERVICE BOARD OR RETIREE HEALTH TRUST FUND BOARD TO ORDER ELECTIONS."}}
