This charge may be added to and become part of any underlying obligation other than an obligation which constitutes a lien on real property; and a different method of payment of that payment and future payments by the person who issued the check may be prescribed by the Treasurer. Any charge imposed for a returned check by either the Treasurer or a court shall be deposited in the General Fund of the City and County. \n(Added by Ord. 179-79, App. 4/20/79; amended by Ord. 313-00, File No. 001908, App. 12/28/2000; Ord. 133-03, File No. 030627, App. 5/30/2003; Ord. 186-06, File No. 060767, App. 7/21/2006) \n\n","heading":{"title":"10","chaptersection":"13-1. ","identifier":"10.13-1. ","catch_text":"CHARGE FOR PERSONAL CHECKS RETURNED WITHOUT PAYMENT."}}
