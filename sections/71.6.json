{"text":"\n     The Planning Department shall determine the amount of a fee necessary to compensate the City for processing and administering an application for a historical property contract. The fee shall pay for the time and materials required to process the application, based upon the estimated actual costs to perform the work, including the costs of the Planning Department, the City Attorney, and the Assessor-Recorder. The City may also impose a separate fee, following approval of the historical property contract, to pay for the actual costs of inspecting the qualified historical property and enforcing the historical property contract. In the event that the costs of processing the application are lower than the estimates, such differences shall be refunded to the applicant. In the event the costs exceed the estimate, the Planning Department shall provide the applicant with a written analysis of the additional fee necessary to complete the review of the application, and applicant shall pay the additional amount prior to execution of the historical property contract. Failure to pay any fees shall be grounds for cancelling the historical property contract. \n(Added by Ord. 191-96, App. 5/22/96; amended by Ord. 271-09, File No. 091137, App. 12/18/2009)\n\n","heading":{"title":"71","chaptersection":"6. ","identifier":"71.6. ","catch_text":"FEES."}}
