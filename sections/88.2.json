{"text":"\n     (a)     Findings. Waste and inefficiency in City programs undermine the confidence of San Francisco residents and reduce the City's ability to adequately address vital public needs. The City is seriously disadvantaged in its efforts to improve program efficiency and effectiveness because of insufficient articulation of program vision, mission and goals, including inadequate information on program performance. And the Board of Supervisors' policy making, spending decisions, and program oversight are seriously handicapped by insufficient attention to program performance and results. \n     (b)     Purposes. This ordinance is adopted to implement the mandate of Charter Section \n16.120, requiring each department of the City and County to adopt an annual Customer Service Plan, in a format to be determined by the Board of Supervisors by ordinance. \n          The purposes of this ordinance are to: \n          1.     Improve program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new focus on fiscal management, capital management, human resources, managing for results, information technology, service quality, and customer satisfaction; \n          2.     Help the City improve service delivery by requiring that it identify program objectives and by providing it with management tools to evaluate service quality; and, \n          3.     Assist Board of Supervisors' decision-making by providing more objective information on performance and customer satisfaction and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of City programs and spending. \n(Added by Ord. 1-00, File No. 991879, App. 1/13/2000)\n\n","heading":{"title":"88","chaptersection":"2. ","identifier":"88.2. ","catch_text":"FINDINGS AND PURPOSES."}}
