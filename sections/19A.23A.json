{"text":"\n     SECTION 1. Title. \n     This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the \"Treatment on Demand Act\". \n     SECTION 2. Findings and Purpose. \n          a)     Substance abuse treatment services are essential services that provide hope and dignity for individuals and a pathway out of addiction, which may lead to homelessness and criminal activity. \n          b)     Substance abuse treatment services are a key component to San Francisco's Continuum of Care Plan, the official homeless policy of the City and County of San Francisco as approved by the Board of Supervisors on February 26, 2008 and by the Mayor on February 29, 2008. \n          c)     Over the past several years, the City and County of San Francisco has inconsistently prioritized substance abuse treatment services. \n          d)     As a result of these inconsistencies, many of the people in need of services are turned away for lack of available treatment slots. \n          e)     This initiative requires that the City and County of San Francisco provide a level of treatment services commensurate with the demand for these services. \n(Added by Proposition T, 11/4/2008)\n\n","heading":{"title":"19A","chaptersection":"23A. ","identifier":"19A.23A. ","catch_text":"TREATMENT ON DEMAND SERVICES."}}
