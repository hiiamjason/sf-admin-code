{"text":"\n     The San Francisco Public Library (\"Library\") Commission shall be authorized to establish a library fee amnesty program to take place during a two-week period prior to July 1, 2001. The Library Commission, after notice and public hearing, is authorized to waive all fees charged for overdue San Francisco Public Library materials (\"late fees\") based on a finding that this amnesty program is likely to promote the return of needed Library materials or promote the increased use of the Library. Such amnesty program shall allow persons to return overdue Library materials without having to pay any late fees. However, in order for a person to obtain a waiver of their late fees, such person must return all overdue materials on their Library account during the two-week amnesty period designated by the Library Commission. The Board of Supervisors, by resolution, may authorize the Library Commission to establish subsequent Library fee amnesty programs under the standards set forth in this section. \n(Added by Ord. 64-01, File No. 010452, App. 4/27/2001)\n\n","heading":{"title":"8","chaptersection":"21-3. ","identifier":"8.21-3. ","catch_text":"LIBRARY FEE AMNESTY PROGRAM."}}
