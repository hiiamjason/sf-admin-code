This plan should also be reflected in the City budget. \n     The City and County shall not reduce funding, staffing or the number of substance abuse treatment slots available for as long as slots are filled or there is any number of individuals seeking such slots. \n     Nothing in this section shall diminish, interfere with or otherwise alter the Mayor's authority under Article III, section \n3.100(13) of the Charter. \n(Added by Proposition T, 11/4/2008)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
