{"text":"\n     (A)     In addition to the general findings set forth in Section \n12D.A.2, and based upon the record before this Board, the Board hereby finds that the evidence before the Board relating to the award of professional services contracts for fiscal years 1993-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-2003 reflects that MBEs and WBEs continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices when competing for City prime professional service contracts. Further, the Board finds that race-neutral measures employed by the City do not prevent such discrimination against MBEs and WBEs from occurring. \n     (B)     Contract awarding authorities shall apply bid/ratings discounts as enumerated in Section \n12D.A.9(A) to all bids and proposals as enumerated in Section \n12D.A.9(A) to all professional service contracts the estimated cost of which exceeds $10,000. Where professional service contracts are formally bid, all consultants selection panels and awarding officers shall apply the bid/rating discounts to each stage of the selection process, e.g., qualifications, proposals and interviews. Minorities and women shall be included on consultant selection panels. \n     (C)     The Director is empowered to take actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, including, without limitation, intervening in the selection process by modifying the criteria used to select selection panelists or prime professional service contractors to correct any contracting practice that hinders equal business opportunities for MBEs and WBEs. \n(Added by Ord. 296-98, App. 10/5/98; amended by Ord. 134-03, File No. 030347, App. 6/1/2003)\n\n","heading":{"title":"12D","chaptersection":"A.13","identifier":"12D.A.13","catch_text":"CONSULTANTS AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES CONTRACTS."}}
