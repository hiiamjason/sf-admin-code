{"text":"\n     To the extent that any ordinance, Code provision or Charter provision gives the City, or any of its commissions, boards or departments, power to award Leases without competitive bidding, it shall be City policy that, notwithstanding such power, all such Leases that are expected to produce more than $2,500 per month in revenue be awarded in accordance with Competitive Bidding Procedures, unless such Competitive Bidding Procedures are impractical or impossible. It shall also be City policy that any and all Leases awarded without following the Competitive Bid Procedures shall be in an amount not less than the fair market value of the leased property. If any City department wishes to award a Lease of City-owned property for less than fair market value, it shall make a finding of the public purpose to be served by such Lease, and such Lease and finding shall be subject to the prior approval of the Mayor and the department head, as well as the applicable commission. If there is no commission approval, then such Lease and finding shall also be subject to the prior approval of the Board of Supervisors. The Lease shall also require that the tenant will use the leased premises in accordance with the stated public purpose for the entire lease term. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any leases awarded pursuant to San Francisco Administrative Code \nChapter 23A, the Surplus City Property Ordinance. \n(Formerly Sec. 23.24; added by Ord. 323-86, App. 8/8/86; amended and renumbered by Ord. 15-01, File No. 001965, App. 2/2/2001; amended by Ord. 278-04, File No. 041352, App. 11/18/2004.
