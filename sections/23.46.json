The monthly fee shall be based upon an appraisal by the Director of Property of the enhancement in fair market value of the building owner's Real Property that will result from installation of the proposed openings in building walls. \n     If the original monthly fee based upon the Director of Property's appraisal is more than $50 the agreement shall provide for payment by the building owner, in advance, of the monthly fee so determined by the Director of Property. The monthly fee may, at the Director of Property's discretion, be payable monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually. The agreement shall contain a provision for annual adjustment of the monthly fee to reflect increases or decreases in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers for the San Francisco-Oakland Metropolitan Area and a provision for a redetermination of the monthly fee by the Director of Property, upon the same appraisal basis as the original fee determination, at the end of each five-year period. \n     If the original monthly fee based upon the Director of Property's appraisal is $50 or less, a one-time fee of $1,000 shall be paid by the building owner and no monthly fees shall be payable. \n(Formerly Sec. 23.28; added by Ord. 559-85, App. 12/27/85; amended and renumbered by Ord. 15-01, File No. 001965, App. 2/2/2001)\n\n","heading":{"title":"23","chaptersection":"46. ","identifier":"23.46. ","catch_text":"DETERMINATION OF VALUE."}}
