In such notice, the department head, or his or her designee, shall also indicate the extent to which such loss of revenue may cause a negative impact on the quality, quantity or availability of the department's services or operations. Where a department establishes that such loss of Funding will cause the department to substantially reduce the quality, quantity or availability of its services or operations, the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor shall treat such information as a significant factor in favor of granting the department a funding appropriation in an amount equal to the estimated loss of Funding during the applicable fiscal year. \n(Added by Ord. 206-01, File No. 010940, App. 10/19/2001)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
