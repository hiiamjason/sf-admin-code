The Board may overturn this decision by a supermajority vote of the members present at the meeting at which the matter is presented. \n     The prohibition on the issuance of bonds for any remaining bond authorization may be lifted by the Board after the agency provides the committee and the Board with documentation of corrective action satisfactory to the Board. \n(Added by Proposition F, 3/5/2002)\n\n","heading":{"title":"5","chaptersection":"34","identifier":"5.34","catch_text":"WASTE."}}
