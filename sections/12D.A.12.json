{"text":"\n     (A)     In addition to the general findings set forth in Section \n12D.A.2, and based upon the record before this Board, the Board hereby finds that the evidence before this Board relating to the award of prime architect/engineering contracts for fiscal years 1992-93, 1993-94, 1994-95, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-2003 reflects that MBEs and WBEs continue to be disadvantaged by discriminatory practices when competing for City prime architect/engineering contracts. The Board further finds that race-neutral measures employed by the City have not prevented these discriminatory practices from occurring. \n     (B)     Contract awarding authorities and architect/engineering selection panels shall apply all bid/rating discounts as enumerated in Section \n12D.A.9(A) to all bids and proposals for architect/engineering contracts, the estimated cost of which exceeds $10,000. Where Architect/Engineering contracts are formally bid, all consultants selection panels and awarding officers shall apply the bid/rating discounts to each stage of the selection process, e.g., qualifications, proposals and interviews. Minorities and women shall be included on consultant selection panels. \n     (C)     The Director is empowered to take actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of this ordinance, including, without limitation, intervening in the selection process, by modifying the criteria used for selecting selection panelists or prime architect/engineering contractors to correct any contracting practices that hinder equal business opportunities for MBEs and WBEs. \n(Added by Ord. 296-98, App. 10/5/98; amended by Ord. 134-03, File No. 030347, App. 6/1/2003)\n\n","heading":{"title":"12D","chaptersection":"A.12","identifier":"12D.A.12","catch_text":"ARCHITECT/ENGINEERING CONTRACTS."}}
