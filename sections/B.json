The department shall provide as supporting documents to the resolution all relevant materials, including but not limited to the funding source's grant criteria, the department's most recent draft of its grant application materials, anticipated funding categories that the department will establish in the subsequent Request for Proposals (RFPs) process, and comments from any relevant citizen advisory body. Should the department fail to submit the resolution and/or supporting documents prior to the 60-day deadline, all funds received through the grant application shall be placed on reserve at the Board of Supervisors. \n          For applications for annual or otherwise recurring grants of $5,000,000 or more that anticipate the issuance of Requests for Proposals, the department head shall submit a resolution articulating anticipated funding categories to the Board of Supervisors at least 60 days prior to the issuance of the RFPs for review and approval. The department shall provide as supporting documents to the resolution all relevant materials, including but not limited to the funding source's grant criteria, the department's most recent draft of its grant application materials, and comments from any relevant citizen advisory body. Should the department fail to submit the resolution and/or supporting documents prior to the 60-day deadline, all funds received through the grant application shall be placed on reserve at the Board of Supervisors. \n          The Board of Supervisors shall approve the resolution before the department head issues the RFPs. Should the Board of Supervisors neither approve nor disapprove a resolution submitted by a department head for review and approval by three business days prior to the issuance date for RFPs, the department head may issue the RFPs. \n          In exercising its powers of review and approval of the aforementioned grant applications, the Board of Supervisors shall take into account whether, and to what degree, its policy priorities, and those expressed by the Mayor's Office and any applicable citizen advisory bodies, have been addressed. \n     (c)     The provisions of subsection (b) above are not intended to apply to annual or otherwise recurring Department of Homeland Security grants, grants for equipment purchases, or capital grants used only for capital improvements or as authorized by federal or State law. \n(Amended by Ord. 93-86, App. 3/21/86; Ord. 204-90, App. 6/8/90; Ord. 401-90, App. 12/20/90; Ord. 187-91, App. 5/23/91; Ord. 301-91, App. 8/6/91; Ord. 931-97, App. 10/17/97; Ord. 265-05, File No. 051414, App. 11/18/2005) \n\nSEC. 10.170-1.  GRANT FUNDS – ACCEPTANCE AND EXPENDITURE.\n     (a)     Any department, board, or commission that seeks to accept and expend federal, State, or other grant funds must comply with any applicable provisions of this Section.\n     (b)     The acceptance and expenditure of federal, State, or other grant funds in the amount of $100,000 or more is subject to the approval by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. If, as a condition of the grant, the City is required to provide any matching funds, those funds shall be included in determining whether the grant meets the $100,000 threshold. This subsection shall also apply to an increase in a grant where the increase, alone or in combination with any other previous increases to that grant, would raise the cumulative total amount of the grant to $100,000 or more. The department, board, or commission requesting approval shall submit the following documents to the Board prior to its consideration:\n          (1)     A proposed resolution approving the acceptance and expenditure of grant funds, or a proposed ordinance as required under subsection (b),\n1 signed by the department head, the Mayor or his or her designee, and the Controller; \n          (2)     A completed \"Grant Information Form.\" The Clerk of the Board shall prepare the form; it shall include a disability access checklist, indirect cost recovery, and other information as the Board of Supervisors may require; \n          (3)     A copy of the grant application;\n          (4)     A letter of intent to award the grant or acknowledgment of grant award from the granting agency; and,\n          (5)     A cover letter to the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors substantially conforming to the specifications of the Clerk of the Board.\n     (c)     Grants or Increases to Grants of Less Than $100,000. The Controller may prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of federal, State, or other grant funds in amounts less than $100,000, or for increases to grants where the increase, alone or in combination with any other previous increases to that grant, would not raise the cumulative total amount of the grant to $100,000 or more. The Controller may also prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of increases to grants, where the original grant or any subsequent increase to the grant has been approved by the Board of Supervisors under subsection (b) or (d) and where the latest increase would be in an amount less than $50,000.\n     (d)     Grant Funded Positions. No position funded by a grant, regardless of the amount of the grant, shall be authorized or filled unless the classification, duration, and number of positions to be funded by the grant are specifically set forth in an ordinance approving acceptance and expenditure, which ordinance shall also contain appropriate amendments to the annual salary ordinance to reflect the positions proposed to be funded through the grant. \n     (e)     Recurring Grants. Grants that provide funding to departments or programs of the City and County in a recurring manner or continue funding from one year to the next shall be included in the annual budget submission by the Department. \n          The Department budget submission shall also include a budget detail, explanations and substantiations of the grant funding. If it is not possible for the Department to include recurring grant funds in its annual Department budget submission, the acceptance and expenditure of a recurring grant shall follow the procedure set forth in paragraph (a)\n2 of this Section. \n     (f)     Indirect Costs. Every grant shall contain provisions for the reimbursement of indirect costs. Such indirect cost provisions shall reimburse the City and County from grant funds for administrative services that are necessary for the administration and performance of the project or program. Every department, office, board or commission shall establish a rate for such indirect costs that is approved by the Controller and fixed in accordance with a directive issued by the Controller. The indirect cost rate shall be included in the grant budget that is submitted to the Board of Supervisors and in the authorizing resolution. \n          The receipt and expenditure of grant funds shall not be approved by the Board of Supervisors unless the Controller has certified that provisions for appropriate indirect cost reimbursement is included in the grant budget. \n          If indirect costs are not allowed by the funding agency, or for other reasons indirect costs cannot be included in the budget, these reasons shall be stated in the authorizing resolution. Upon approving acceptance and expenditure, the Board of Supervisors may waive the requirement for the inclusion of reimbursement of indirect costs. \n     (g)     Grant Budget. Every department, board, commission, agency, or office submitting a budget for a grant of public funds to the Board of Supervisors pursuant to this Section shall submit such budget in a format that conforms to and provides the detail substantiation that is required of similar appropriations in the annual budget for the City and County. The mission and goals statement, which is required as part of the annual budget, is not required by this Section for submittal of a grant budget. \n     (h)     Grant Budget Revision. A department, agency, or office may reallocate or transfer funds of line item expenditures within an approved grant budget, if such reallocations or transfers are within the total of the approved budget and are allowed by the granting agency. If any line item of a Federal or State grant is modified or increased by more than 15 percent, copies of documentation of such modification or increase which are transmitted to Federal or State agencies shall also be transmitted to the Board of Supervisors. \n     (i)     Grant Draw Down of Funds. Departments, agencies, boards, and commissions shall promptly draw down grant funds from a Federal, State, or other funding agency and deposit such funds in the Treasury of the City and County of San Francisco to minimize the displacement of City funds that support grant activities. \n     (j)     Grant Transportation Authority. The provisions of this Section shall not be applicable to applications for or expenditure of funds from the San Francisco County Transportation Authority. The Controller shall prescribe rules for the acceptance and expenditure of such funds. \n     (k)     Certain Transportation Funds (Proposition 1B Funds). The voters of California adopted Proposition 1B, the Highway Safety, Traffic Reduction, Air Quality, and Port Security Bond Act of 2006, at the November 7, 2006 California General Election. Under the Proposition, the State will appropriate two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) into the Local Streets and Road Improvement, Congestion Relief, and Traffic Safety Account of 2006 (\"Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds\"). These funds will be distributed to cities and counties for improvements to transportation facilities that will assist in reducing local traffic congestion and further deterioration, improving traffic flows, or increasing traffic safety that may include, but not be limited to, street and highway pavement, maintenance, rehabilitation, installation, construction and reconstruction of necessary associated facilities such as drainage and traffic control devices, or the maintenance, rehabilitation, installation, construction and reconstruction of facilities that expand ridership on transit systems, safety projects to reduce fatalities, or as a local match to obtain state or federal transportation funds for similar purposes. The Proposition requires that the funds distributed to the City be deposited in a local account that is designated for the receipt of state funds allocated for local streets and roads. \n          (1)     The Board of Supervisors finds that while there are a range of projects involving various City departments that could benefit from the Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, implementing a coordinated planning process for use of those funds will help ensure the effective and efficient expenditure of funds in a manner that will maximize the benefit to the City and its residents. \n          (2)     The Board of Supervisors further finds that given the range of projects and the Citywide impact of transportation-related projects, it is appropriate for the Board to review proposed expenditures of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, and to be kept apprised of the progress on projects that are receiving Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds. \n          (3)     The Board of Supervisors shall not to appropriate any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, as referenced above, until the Board has received from the department or departments requesting the appropriations a specific and detailed spending plan for the funds. The Spending Plan (the \"Plan\") shall set forth projects, programs and other improvements to be funded over the next ten years (10) years by Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds, and shall include a budget, scope, and schedule, as well as any other information requested by the Board. The Plan should also address the relative need or urgency, cost effectiveness, and fair geographic distribution of resources, taking into account the various needs of San Francisco's neighborhoods. The Plan shall be coordinated with other relevant City agencies including the Planning Department and the Municipal Transportation Agency, as well as the San Francisco Transportation Authority. The Plan should identify attempts to leverage or match Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds with funding from other sources, including any other state or federal funds. No City Department shall expend or encumber any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds without approval from the Board of Supervisors pursuant to this ordinance. Any Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds received by the City and County of San Francisco will be deposited into a local account named \"The Proposition 1B Local Account,\" and shall remain in such account until the Board of Supervisors approves a department's specific spending plan. Under no circumstances will Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds be mixed with other funds prior to the approval of the spending plans as outlined in this paragraph. Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds can be appropriated as part of the annual budget process only if the requirements of this paragraph are met. The Board of Supervisors further encourages any department seeking such an appropriation to consult and work with its commission if any, the public, and the Board on the development of such spending plans. \n          (4)     Any department that receives an appropriation of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds shall report back to the Board of Supervisors beginning six months from the date of the appropriation, and at six-month intervals thereafter until the appropriation has been spent. The report required by this Section shall state the amount of Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds expended as of the reporting date and shall describe the progress on the project, the projected date of completion, and such additional information as the Board may require as a condition of the appropriation. \n          (5)     The Controller shall perform an audit every two years of all Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds that are allocated, whether expended or not, to determine what projects were actually funded. Any Department receiving Proposition 1B Local Street and Road Improvement Funds shall cooperate with the Controller's Office in the performance of the audit. \n(Added by Ord. 391-97, App. 10/17/97; amended by Ord. 230-06, File No. 060852, App. 9/14/2006; Ord. 102-07, File No. 070316, App. 5/4/2007; Ord. 97-12, File No. 120192, App. 5/29/2012, Eff. 6/28/2012)\nCODIFICATION NOTE\n\n1.     So in Ord. 97-12; the reference should be to division (d).\n\n2.     So in Ord. 97-12; the reference should be to division (b).\n\nSEC. 10.170-2.  ACCOUNTING FOR GRANTS; DUTIES OF CONTROLLER, OFFICERS, BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS.\n     Upon receipt of a federal, State or other grant, the officer, employer, board or commission authorized to file application therefor pursuant to the provisions of Section \n10.170 hereof, shall forthwith notify the Controller of such receipt.

In those cases where the Controller determines that the recipient agency has failed in its budget estimate to make the allocation of funds for transfer to the General Fund to defray the cost of rendering services or providing facilities to all service rendering agencies, calculated pursuant to its general service charge, the Controller shall make the appropriate allocation by reducing expenditures for other items in the budget estimates. \n(Added by Ord. 152-80, App. 4/18/80; amended by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.199-1.\n(Amended by Ord. 59-83, App. 2/4/83; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.201.\n(Added by Ord. 58-82, App. 2/11/82; amended by Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nSec. 10.203.\n(Added by Ord. 342-87, App. 8/21/87; amended by Ord. 283-90, App. 7/24/90; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.204.\n(Added by Ord. 416-93, App. 12/23/93; amended by Ord. 79-96, App. 2/23/96; Ord. 278-96, App. 7/3/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000) \nSec. 10.205.\n(Added by Ord. 376-96, App. 9/30/96; repealed by Ord. 319-00, File No. 001914, App. 12/28/2000)\nARTICLE XIX:\n[RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE XX:\nLIEN PROCEDURE \n\n\nSec. 10.230.\nApplicability.\n\nSec. 10.230A.\nRequest for Payment; Notice of Delinquent Account and Proposed Lien; Authorization for Lien.\n\nSec. 10.231.\nReport to Board of Supervisors.\n\nSec. 10.232.\nNotice of Hearing.\n\nSec. 10.233.\nHearing.\n\nSec. 10.234.\nCreation of Lien.\n\nSec. 10.235.\nRecordation.\n\nSec. 10.236.\nFiling With Controller and Tax Collector; Distribution of Proceeds.\n\nSec. 10.237.\nRelease of Lien, Recording Fee. \n\nSEC. 10.230.  APPLICABILITY.\n     The following procedures are adopted pursuant to California Government Code Section 54988 and/or the Charter City Powers of City and County of San Francisco. Where an ordinance of the City and County of San Francisco authorizes the creation and imposition of a lien to enforce financial obligations owed to the City and County of San Francisco, the procedure set forth herein shall govern unless a different lien procedure is specifically provided for. If another ordinance of the City and County authorizes a different lien procedure which is subsequently declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the procedures set forth in this Article shall apply. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.230A.  REQUEST FOR PAYMENT; NOTICE OF DELINQUENT ACCOUNT AND PROPOSED LIEN; AUTHORIZATION FOR LIEN.\n     (a)     Prior to initiating proceedings under this Article for the imposition of a lien, the department seeking to collect the fee, charge or cost at issue shall mail the property owner a written request for payment. If the fee, charge or cost has not been paid within 30 calendar days of such notice, the department may initiate lien proceedings pursuant to this Article to recover the amount due. Where another ordinance authorizing a specific lien requires not less than 30 calendar days written notice to the property owner prior to the initiation of lien proceedings, that notice shall constitute compliance with this Subsection. \n     (b)     A department seeking to initiate lien proceedings shall, following the end of the 30 calendar day period set forth in subsection (a), send the property owner via certified mail a written notice of proposed lien that shall include information as to the amount due, instructions for payment, and the name and telephone number of a department official to contact for questions or further information. The notice shall further state that if the amount due is not paid within 45 days, it shall be considered a delinquent account subject to lien pursuant to this Article and that before the lien may be imposed, the property owner has the right to appear before the Board of Supervisors at a hearing regarding the amount due. The notice shall also state that if the obligation remains unpaid, administrative fees, penalties and interest (including interest on amounts due after they have become a lien and continuing until paid) pursuant to this Article will accrue and become part of the lien. \n     (c)     To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien does not provide for notice, or establishes lesser notice requirements, this section shall establish minimum notice requirements. To the extent that an ordinance authorizing a specific lien establishes greater or additional notice requirements, those notice requirements shall control. The provisions of this section are not intended to affect any notice requirements imposed by preemptive State or federal law. \n     (d)     A financial obligation that is subject to this Article, and which remains unpaid after 45 calendar days from the date of the notice required pursuant to subsection (b) shall be deemed a delinquent account. In accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article, the Board of Supervisors may ensure collection of a delinquent account by making the amount thereof, along with any administrative charges, penalties, fees and interest, a lien against the subject property. \n(Added by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.231.  REPORT TO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.\n     Each head of a department or office shall report not less than annually to the Board of Supervisors on delinquent accounts as provided herein. The report to the Board of Supervisors shall contain the following information for each such delinquent account: \n     1.     The property owner's name;\n     2.     The purpose of the charge, the payment for which is overdue;\n     3.     The amount due, including penalty and interest;\n     4.     The amount of the unpaid balance, including penalty on the delinquent payment;\n     5.     A description of the parcel or property against which a lien may be assessed. The descriptions of the parcels shall be those used for the same parcels on the Assessor's map books for the current year; and \n     6.     A recommendation on whether the lien procedure is appropriate for such delinquent account; and if not, a detailed explanation of inappropriateness shall be included. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.232.  NOTICE OF HEARING.\n     Upon receipt of such report the Board shall fix a time, date and place for a hearing on the report and any protest or objections thereto, and shall cause notice of the hearing to be sent by certified mail to each owner of the property described in the report not less than 10 days prior to the date of hearing. Such notice shall be mailed to the owner at the address maintained by the Tax Collector for the mailing of property tax bills. In addition, where the proposed lien would be entitled to greater force, effect and priority than that provided by law for a judgment lien, a copy of the notice shall be mailed to other persons who have a recorded interest in the property. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.233.  HEARING.\n     At the time fixed for the hearing on the report, the Board of Supervisors shall consider it along with any protests or objections of the owners of the properties liable to be assessed for delinquent accounts or other persons with a recorded interest in one or more of the properties. The Board may make such revisions, corrections or modifications of the report as it may deem necessary. In the event that the Board is satisfied with the correctness of the report (as submitted or as revised, corrected or modified), it shall be confirmed by resolution. The decision of the Board on the report and on all protests or objections thereto shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, any delinquent account may be removed from the report by payment in full at any time prior to confirmation of the report. The Clerk of the Board shall cause the confirmed report to be verified in form sufficient to meet recording requirements. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.234.  CREATION OF LIEN.\n     Upon recordation of the confirmed report by the Board, the delinquent charges contained therein shall constitute a lien against the property. \n     The lien shall continue until the lien value and all interest, fees and penalties due and payable thereon are paid. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of ordinary municipal taxes shall be applicable to said lien, subject to two exceptions: (1) if any real property to which the lien would attach has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of taxes would become delinquent, then the lien that would otherwise be imposed by this Section shall not attach to the real property and the costs of enforcement relating to the property shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection; and (2) liens recorded pursuant to this Article shall only have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien unless State law confers a different priority. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.235.  RECORDATION.\n     The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall cause the confirmed and verified report to be recorded in the County Recorder's office. The lien on each parcel of property described in said report shall carry additional charges for administrative expenses of $50 or 10 percent of the amount owed, whichever is higher, together with interest at the rate of one percent per full month compounded monthly from the date of recordation of the lien on all charges due. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.236.  FILING WITH CONTROLLER AND TAX COLLECTOR; DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS.\n     The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors shall file a certified copy of each confirmed report with the Controller and Tax Collector within 10 days after confirmation of the report, whereupon it shall be the duty of said officers to add the amount of said lien to the next regular bill for taxes levied against said property for municipal purposes, and thereafter said amount shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City and County ad valorem real property taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for property taxes of the City and County of San Francisco, except that in conducting such a foreclosure and sale, the City shall have only the authority and priority that it is entitled to for enforcement of a judgment lien unless state law confers a different priority. \n     Except for the release of lien recording fee authorized in Section \n10.237, where the expenditure of City funds for which the lien is being imposed was made from departmental funds, all sums collected by the Tax Collector pursuant to this Article shall be allocated to the credit of the department for which the lien was imposed and to such other City departments as are administering collection of the lien for reimbursement of those expenses. Where the costs for which the lien is imposed have been paid from the General Fund instead of departmental funds, the sums collected shall be deposited in the General Fund, and not allocated to the department for which the lien was imposed. Unless otherwise authorized by law, the proceeds of the lien transferred to the department may be used only to fund the activities or undertakings the charge leading to the lien was designed to fund. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 10.237.  RELEASE OF LIEN, RECORDING FEE.\n     Upon payment to the Tax Collector of the lien amount plus applicable penalties, administrative fees and interest charges, the Tax Collector shall cause to be recorded a Release of Lien with the County Recorder, and from the sum collected pursuant to Section \n10.236, shall pay to the County Recorder a Release of Lien fee of $9.00. \n(Added by Ord. 29-89, App. 1/25/89; amended by Ord. 321-00, File No. 001916, App. 12/28/2000)\nCHAPTER 10A:\n[RESERVED]\nSEC. 10A.1.  RESERVED.\n(Added by Ord. 274-06, File No. 060700)\nEditor's Note:     Former Ch. 10A (\"Pilot Foot Patrol Program\") expired by operation of its sunset provision on 1/1/2008.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
