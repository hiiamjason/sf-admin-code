Professional service contracts shall provide for a Guaranteed Maximum Cost, including fees, travel and related expenses as necessitated by the project. Any modification to the Guaranteed Maximum Cost must be approved by the department head in writing and approved by the Mayor, the Mayor's designee or the board or commission concerned, as appropriate, and the Controller. \n     (B)     Insurance. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Chapter, all professional service contracts must conform to the insurance requirements established by the Risk Manager. The Risk Manager shall develop uniform insurance requirements for City contracts subject to this Chapter and shall publish such requirements in the Risk Manager's Manual. The Risk Manager shall review and update such insurance requirements on an annual basis. \n     (C)     Indemnification. All professional services contracts awarded under this Chapter shall require that the contractor fully indemnify the City and County to the maximum extent provided by law, such that each contractor must save, keep, bear harmless and fully indemnify the City and County and any of its officers or agents from any and all liability, damages, claims, judgments or demands for damages, costs or expenses in law or equity that may at any time arise. \n          This indemnification requirement may not be waived or abrogated in any way for any contract without the recommendation of the City's Risk Manager and the express permission and approval of the Board of Supervisors. \n     (D)     Assignment. No contract shall be assigned except upon the recommendation of the department head concerned and with the approval of the Mayor or the Mayor's designee, relative to the department under the Mayor's jurisdiction or the approval of the board or commission concerned for departments not under the Mayor. \n     (E)     Modifications. Professional service contracts may be modified only by written instrument, granted and approved by the City and County in the same manner the underlying contract was awarded. \n     (F)     Contractor Prompt Payment. All professional services contracts under this Chapter shall require the contractor to pay its subcontractors within seven calendar days after receipt of each progress payment from the City, unless otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by both contractor and subcontractor. In the event that there is a good faith dispute over all or any portion of the amount due on a progress payment from a contractor to a subcontractor, the contractor may withhold the disputed amount but shall pay the undisputed amount.\n          Any contractor who violates this subsection shall pay to the subcontractor a penalty of 2% of the amount due per month for every month or portion thereof that payment is not made.

The Board of Supervisors may declare an emergency and may direct any department head to perform any repair or other emergency work in any manner the Board determines to be in the best interests of the City and County of San Francisco. \n     (B)     Other Determinations of Emergency. In an actual emergency as defined or described below, the repair, reconditioning or other work or contract necessitated by the emergency may be executed by the department head responsible for such work in the most expeditious manner, in accordance with the procedures set forth below. \n     (C)     Emergency Defined. For purposes of this Chapter, an \"actual emergency\" means a sudden, unforeseeable and unexpected occurrence involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of or damage to, life, health property or essential public services. An \"actual emergency\" shall also mean the discovery of any condition involving a clear and imminent danger to public health or safety, demanding immediate action. Examples of an actual emergency may include, but are not limited to, the following: \n          (1)     Weather conditions, fire, flood, earthquake or other unforeseen occurrences of unusual character; or\n          (2)     The breakdown or imminent breakdown of any plant, equipment, structure, street or public work necessitating immediate emergency repair or reconditioning to safeguard the lives or property of the citizens; or the property of the City and County; or to maintain the public health or welfare; and \n               (a)     Including the installation, repair, construction and alteration of crossings and switch work and special work in connection therewith at street and other railway crossings and at street intersections when the same is to be done by or for the Municipal Transportation Agency; or \n               (b)     Including the installation, repair, construction and alteration of the fire alarm, police communication and traffic signal systems, when the same is to be performed by or for the Department of Technology or the Municipal Transportation Agency; or \n               (c)     Including the work of making connections, installing gate valves, installing or transferring services and performing such other work therewith to existing water pipes when the same is to be done by or for the Public Utilities Commission and when such work will leave one or more fire hydrants or water consumers without water; or \n          (3)     Unforeseen occurrences of unusual character resulting in an insufficient number of hospital beds or the lack of hospital beds or the lack of hospital, surgical, mental health or hospital ancillary services so as to leave patients of the City and County without required hospital or medical services. \n     (D)     Approvals Required. If the estimated cost of the emergency work is less than or equal to $250,000 the department head may proceed with the work without additional approvals. If the estimated cost of the emergency work exceeds $250,000, the department head prior to authorizing the commencement of the work, must first secure the approval in writing of the Mayor or the Mayor's designee or the president of the board or commission concerned as appropriate to the department. For all cases where the cost of the emergency work exceeds $250,000 the department head shall also obtain the approval of the Board of Supervisors. \n          If the emergency does not permit the required approvals to be obtained before work is commenced or the contract entered into, such approvals shall be obtained as soon thereafter as it is possible to do so. In such event, the department head concerned shall notify the Controller immediately of the work involved or the contract entered into and the estimated cost thereof and shall notify the Board of Supervisors not more than seven days after work has been commenced. \n     (E)     Exemptions. Contracts awarded in accordance with this section under emergency circumstances as described and defined above are exempt from the requirements of this Chapter and \nChapters 12A, \n12B, \n12C and \nChapter 14B. However, the department head must comply with the certification requirement of Administrative Code \nChapter 14B. It is, however, the policy of the Board of Supervisors for contracting departments to make every effort to comply with the provisions of \nChapters 12A, \n12B, \n12C and \nChapter 14B. In order to effectuate this policy, the department heads authorized to enter into construction contracts and their staff members shall collaborate with the HRC Director and HRC staff members periodically to create a list of responsible contractors qualified to perform various types of emergency work, making every effort to include qualified, responsible, and certified LBE contractors on that list. The HRC shall be responsible for outreach efforts to make sure that certified LBE contractors are aware of the opportunity to be considered for the list. The contract awarding departments or commissions shall be responsible for evaluating and determining whether contractors are responsible and qualified to perform the various scopes of work. The department heads of departments authorized to execute construction contracts shall report quarterly to the Board of Supervisors regarding LBE inclusion on the list of responsible and qualified contractors for emergency contracts, a description of each emergency contract awarded, the reason why the work was performed under these emergency procedures, and whether the emergency contract was awarded to an LBE contractor. Such reports shall be referred to a Board committee for public hearing. \n     (F)     Indemnification For Emergency Contracts. Department heads responsible for any emergency work are hereby authorized to (a) waive any requirement that a contractor performing such emergency work indemnify the City and County and/or (b) enter into a contract which provides that the City and County indemnify such contractor, except that the City and County shall in no event indemnify a contractor for the contractor's gross negligence or willful misconduct. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99; amended by Ord. 58-05, File No. 041571, App. 4/1/2005; Ord. 19-10, File No. 091163, App. 2/10/2010) \n\nSEC. 6.61.  DESIGN-BUILD.\n     The department heads authorized to execute contracts for public work projects are authorized to seek proposals from qualified private entities (\"design-builders\") for design-build construction and/or financing of public work projects under the following conditions: \n     (A)     Before the request for qualifications is issued, the department head shall determine that a design-build program is necessary or appropriate to achieve anticipated cost savings or time efficiencies, or both, and that such a process is in the public's best interest. \n     (B)     If the proposed public work project is for the use or benefit of a department that is under the jurisdiction of a commission, then such commission shall first approve the solicitation of design-build and/or finance proposals. If the public work project is not for the use or benefit of a department under the jurisdiction of a commission, then the City Administrator must first approve this process. \n     (C)     Pre-Qualification. Department heads shall require that prospective design-builders be pre-qualified to submit proposals on a specific project. The procedure for pre-qualification is as follows: \n          (1)     The department head shall issue a request for qualifications inviting interested parties to submit their qualifications to perform the project. The request for qualifications shall include criteria by which the prospective design-builders will be evaluated during the qualification process. The evaluation criteria shall be based on qualifications and experience relevant to the services needed for the project, including: (i) qualifications to design-build the proposed project; (ii) evidence of financial capacity; (iii) experience on similar projects; (iv) commitment to comply with the goals and requirements of Administrative Code \nChapters 12 and \n14; (v) ability to collaboratively and cooperatively deliver projects on time and on budget; (vi) liquidated damages for delay and other damages paid on prior projects, and prior litigation history; (vii) reputation with owners of prior projects; (viii) claims history with insurance carriers and sureties; and (ix) compliance with all of the requirements established in the request for qualifications and other criteria that the department head may deem appropriate. The department head shall set objective scoring criteria and incorporate the criteria into any scoring procedure. \n          (2)     The department head shall designate a panel to review pre-qualification responses and interview and rate respondents with respect to the request for qualifications. Only those respondents found to be qualified will be eligible to submit proposals. The list of pre-qualified respondents shall be valid for not more than two years following the date of initial pre-qualification. \n          (3)     The department head may establish a pre-qualification selection process whereby the panel ranks respondents and recommends a shortlist of no fewer than three (3) pre-qualified respondents. The department head may restrict bidding to short-listed respondents. The shortlist of pre-qualified respondents shall be valid for not more than two years following the date of initial pre-qualification. \n               D.     Request for Proposals. The department head shall issue a request for proposals inviting pre-qualified design-builders to submit proposals for the project. The request for proposals shall include a criteria package describing preliminary design criteria and performance criteria for the project, as well as any other information deemed necessary to describe adequately the City's needs for the project. \n               E.     Final Selection Process. The department head may recommend the award of a contract to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid. If the award to that bidder is not made for any reason, the department head may recommend the award of a contract to the responsible bidder submitting the next lowest responsive bid, and so forth. The department head may, at his or her sole discretion, conduct any negotiations that are necessary to effectuate the award of a contract. \n               F.     Alternative Final Selection Process. If the project seeks private financing proposals and/or the department head determines that it is in the public's best interest to consider qualifications and/or other subjective criteria (e.g., quality of design proposal) as part of the final selection process, the department head shall issue a request for proposals inviting pre-qualified design-builders to submit design-build proposals, which will be evaluated based upon qualifications and project and/or financing costs. \n          (1)     The department head may request design-builders to create partial designs, which will be evaluated as part of the final selection process. The department head may offer a reasonable stipend to short-listed design-builders to create partial designs. The receipt of a stipend shall be contingent upon a design-builder's proposal being responsive to the request for proposals. \n          (2)     The department head may require short-listed design-builders who are creating partial designs to participate in one or more confidential review meetings with City representatives and/or selection panel members during the proposal preparation period. The purpose of the review meetings will be to ensure that each design-builder's partial design is proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the City as set forth in the criteria package. Discussions during review meetings shall be limited to objective elements of the criteria package. \n          (3)     Design-builders submitting private financing proposals shall provide evidence of the commitment of funds necessary to privately finance the proposed projects to completion. \n          (4)     The department head shall designate a panel to evaluate design-build proposals and rank the proposals to determine which provides the overall best value to the City and County in regard to the following criteria: (1) plan for expediency in completing the proposed project; (2) lifecycle cost to the City and County; (3) qualifications to finance the proposed project; (4) quality of design proposal; (5) compliance with the goals set by the Human Rights Commission and requirements of the Administrative Code \nChapters 12 and \n14; (6) commitment to meet the City hiring goals (e.g., CityBuild or First Source Hiring); (7) if private financing is sought, commitment of funds, cost of funds and terms to the City; and (8) compliance with all the requirements and criteria established by the Department head in the request for proposals. The cost criterion shall constitute not less than sixty-five percent (65%) of the overall evaluation. \n     (G)     Subject to paragraph (K) below, the department head may recommend the award of a contract to the highest-ranked design-builder. If the award to the highest-ranked design-builder is not made for any reason, the department head may recommend the award of a contract to the next highest-ranked design-builder, and so forth. The department head may, at his or her sole discretion, conduct any negotiations that are necessary to effectuate the award of a contract. \n     (H)     The City shall retain the absolute discretion to determine, at any time during the process, not to proceed with any proposed project, which right may be exercised without liability to design-builders for costs incurred during the entire pre-qualification, proposal and negotiation process, and such rights shall be reserved in all requests for qualifications and proposals. \n     (I)     The competitive bid requirements of this Chapter shall not apply to the selection of design-builders under this Section \n6.61.\n     (J)     Design-builders shall comply with all applicable requirements set forth in San Francisco Administrative Code \nChapters 12 and \n14.\n     (K)     All final contracts for a public work project that involve a design-build and/or finance program shall be subject to the award provisions of \nArticle I of this Chapter. If the proposed contract involves a financing program, the Capital Improvement Advisory Committee must review and report on the proposed project before the board, commission, Mayor or his/her designee takes any action with respect to award of the contract. \n     (L)     Procurement of Trade Subcontractors. Department heads may require the selected design-builder to procure trade work contracts through a pre-qualification and competitive bid process, as follows: \n          (1)     Pre-qualification. The department head shall require the design-builder to pre-qualify all trade subcontractors, subject to the approval of the department head. The design-builder shall attempt to establish a pool of no fewer than three pre-qualified subcontractors for each trade package, subject to the approval of the department head. \n          (2)     Competitive Bid. The department head shall require the design-builder to receive sealed bids from the pre-qualified trade subcontractors. The bid security provisions of Section \n6.21 will not apply. The design-builder shall award a trade package subcontract to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid, except that the design-builder may negotiate and award a portion of the trade package subcontracts as provided in paragraph (3), below. Only those Administrative Code provisions that normally apply to subcontracts will apply to the trade package subcontracts. \n          (3)     The department head may authorize the design-builder to negotiate subcontracts for trade work as appropriate for the project, up to an amount not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the total estimated subcontract costs. The department head shall establish a maximum dollar value for each negotiated trade subcontract as appropriate for the project. \n     (M)     All actions heretofore taken by a department head consistent with the provisions of this section are hereby approved.\n     (N)     All design-build projects that are substantially underway as of the effective date of this Subsection \n6.61(N) that do not comply with the mandatory pre-qualification requirements of Subsection \n6.61(C) are hereby approved, provided that the applicable department heads shall only consider proposals from qualified design-builders. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99; amended by Ord. 153-00, File No. 000805, App. 6/30/2000; Ord. 58-05, File No. 041571, App. 4/1/2005; Ord. 18-07, File No. 060344, App. 2/9/2007; Ord. 119-08, File No. 080277, App. 7/11/2008) \n\nSEC. 6.62.  JOB ORDER CONTRACTS.\n     The job order contracting system (\"JOC\") provides for an indefinite quantity contract with a predefined set of bid items that are assigned on a periodic or task order basis for the performance of public work maintenance, repair and minor construction projects. The department heads authorized to execute contracts for public work projects are authorized to utilize JOC according to the procedures set forth below. \n     (A)     Each JOC contract is to be advertised for competitive bids in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Chapter and awarded to the responsible bidder who submits the lowest responsive bid. \n     (B)     The Advertisement For Bids shall include unit prices and detailed technical specifications for each construction task contemplated to be performed under the JOC contract. Each task item shall include direct costs for material, equipment and labor. Construction tasks shall be grouped by trade. \n     (C)     The Advertisement For Bids for a JOC contract shall contain the City's estimate regarding the percentage of work under the JOC contract that will be performed by each trade. The Advertisement For Bids shall also require the Contractor to commit to an LBE Participation Goal, as set by the Human Rights Commission, in the performance of service orders under the JOC Contract. Upon completion of the JOC Contract term, the Human Rights Commission shall verify compliance with the LBE Participation Goal under the provisions of Administrative Code \nChapter 14B. Departments may designate specific JOC Contracts as limited set asides for Micro-LBEs as provided under \nChapter 14B.\n     (D)     Contractor's bid shall include a subcontractor list in conformance with Section 6.21A of this Chapter and \nChapter 14B as appropriate. All requests for substitutions of subcontractors shall be made and considered under Public Contract Code Section 4107, as may be amended from time to time. Notwithstanding this requirement, if a listed subcontractor confirms in writing that it is not available to perform one or more work orders, the contractor may request to add without penalty a subcontractor to perform under the work order(s) at no additional cost to the City. The aggregate value of the work performed by subcontractors added to substitute for listed but unavailable subcontractors shall not exceed 20% of the original contract amount. Specialty trade work unanticipated at the time of bid, requiring the addition of one or more subcontractors, shall be considered the performance of a change order under Public Contract Code Section 4107(c). The addition of any subcontractor under any circumstances or for any purpose shall be effected by change order or contract modification. Prior to any added subcontractor performing any service order work, the awarding department shall confirm the license, insurance coverage, and other qualifying criteria as required by law. \n     (E)     Contractors submitting bids on the JOC contract shall state in their bids an adjustment on a percentage basis either increasing or decreasing the unit prices for all construction tasks set forth in the bid documents. There may be a single adjustment factor that applies to all tasks. For example, an adjustment factor of 25% below the unit prices stated in the bid documents would be bid as .75. All of the contractor's profit, overhead and indirect costs shall be included in the adjusted unit prices. \n     (F)     The Advertisement For Bids and the contract specifications shall contain a maximum dollar amount of the JOC contract, which maximum amount shall not exceed five million dollars. The cumulative modifications to a JOC contract shall result in a contract sum not to exceed one hundred-fifty percent of the original contract amount. \n     (G)     JOC contracts shall provide for an expiration term of not more than five years, including all modifications. However, the department head shall not issue any new work orders under the JOC contract after three years from the date of award. \n     (H)     Projects will be assigned under the JOC contract on a work order basis at the sole discretion of the department head concerned. Each work order shall include a time certain for completion of the work and an appropriate sum for liquidated damages for delay. Each work order shall also include a list of the subcontractors performing work under such order, with each subcontractor's name, business address, San Francisco business tax registration number, contractor license number, scope of work, and data as may be required by the Human Rights Commission. The work order price shall be no more than the calculated unit prices and the bid adjustment factor. No work order shall exceed $400,000, including all modifications. A department may issue or modify any work order(s) to exceed the foregoing limit only upon the department head's written determination establishing the urgency of the work and the justification for proceeding under this Section 6.62 rather than by formal competitive process. \n     (I)     A contractor who enters into a JOC contract with a particular City department is not eligible during the term of such JOC contract to submit a bid on a subsequent JOC contract advertised by the same contracting department; however, a contractor may submit a bid on a subsequent JOC contract advertised by the same contracting department if the contractor's existing JOC contract will expire in 120 days or fewer of if the contractor has performed work valued by the City in an amount equal to or exceeding 90% of the maximum dollar amount of the existing JOC contract. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99; amended by Ord. 324-00, File No. 001919, App. 12/28/2000; Ord. 58-05, File No. 041571, App. 4/1/2005; Ord. 19-10, File No. 091163, App. 2/10/2010) \n\nSEC. 6.63.  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ABATEMENT WORK.\n     When the Director of Public Works (the \"Director\") determines: (1) that hazardous materials on public property must be expeditiously abated (the \"work\"); and (2) that there is inadequate time to advertise and competitively bid the work in accordance with this Chapter, then the work may be performed in accordance with the following procedures: \n     (A)     The Department of Public Works shall advertise for and receive proposals from hazardous materials abatement contractors, which proposals shall address the qualifications of the contractors to perform the abatement work. The proposals shall be evaluated according to the requirements of this Chapter and \nChapters 12B, \n12C and \n12D.A, relevant to professional services contracts. \n     (B)     The Department of Public Works shall select a sufficient number of qualified contractors to perform the amount of hazardous materials abatement work anticipated to be required in the upcoming one or more years and enter into master agreements on an \"if- and as-needed\" basis with those contractors. Each master agreement shall state the maximum total dollar value of work each contractor is authorized to perform during the contract period. \n     (C)     The Department shall seek price quotations for performance of the work from at least three of the contractors with master agreements. The contract for the work will be awarded to the contractor submitting the lowest quotation, except as otherwise provided herein. The Department shall keep a record of such quotations and a register of all awards made thereunder. In the event that the Department is unable to obtain three quotations, the Director shall base the award on the quotation or quotations received. If the Director believes that the public interest would best be served by accepting other than the lowest quotation, he or she is hereby authorized to accept the quotation that in his or her discretion will best serve the public interest. The Director may reject any and all quotations and request new quotations. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99)\n\nSEC. 6.64.  AS-NEEDED CONTRACTS.\n     A department head authorized to execute public work and professional service contracts may issue an Advertisement For Bids for construction services or a request for proposals or qualifications for professional services on an as-needed basis, with definite or indefinite quantities of work. Work shall be assigned on a contract service order basis. None of the requirements of this Chapter or Administrative Code \nChapters 12B, \n12C or \n12D.A are waived for as-needed contracts. \n     All as-needed contracts shall provide for a not-to-exceed price and an expiration term of not more than five years, including all modifications. However, the department head shall not issue any new contract service order after three years from the date of award. Additionally, the cumulative modifications to an as-needed contract shall result in a contract sum not to exceed one hundred-fifty percent of the original contract amount. Before any item of work is commenced under an as-needed contract, the cost of such work must be certified by the Controller as to the availability of funds. No contract service order or multiple contract service orders for any single public work, whether in one phase or multiple phases, shall cumulatively exceed $200,000, including all modifications. For departments with capital programs over $1 Billion, no contract service order or multiple contract service orders, as described above, shall cumulatively exceed $400,000, including all modifications. A department may issue or modify any contract service order(s) to exceed the foregoing limits only upon the department head's written determination establishing the urgency of the work and the justification for proceeding under this Section \n6.64 rather than by formal competitive process. \n     The department heads authorized to execute public work and professional service contracts shall report quarterly to the Board of Supervisors regarding the department's use of as-needed contracts and the actual amount of participation of MBE and WBE subcontractors or subconsultants that were listed on prime contractors' bid(s) or proposal(s) to determine whether MBE/WBE subcontracting participation goals are being met on as-needed contracts. Such reports shall be referred to a Board committee for public hearing. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99; amended by Ord. 58-05, File No. 041571, App. 4/1/2005)\n\nSEC. 6.65.  CONTRACTING FOR ELEVATOR, ESCALATOR, SECURITY, FIRE PROTECTION OR FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS INSPECTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR WORK.\n     Department heads who are authorized to execute public work contracts under this Chapter are hereby authorized to award contracts for the inspection, maintenance and repair services of existing elevator, escalator, security, fire protection or fire alarm systems (\"special services\") in accordance with the following procedures: \n     (A)     The department shall award master agreement contracts, on an \"if-and-as-needed\" basis to special service providers who can establish experience, expertise, and quality of work. A potential special service provider may apply for a master agreement under this section by providing the department with a statement of its experience and qualifications and other information as requested by the department. Within 60 days of receiving such information, the department shall advise the applicant of its eligibility for an award of a master agreement. Master agreements for special services shall conform to the insurance, indemnification and prevailing wage requirements of Section \n6.22 of this Chapter. Master agreements shall provide for an expiration term of not more than five years from the date of award, including all modifications. \n     (B)     For performance of specific tasks, the department shall seek price quotations from at least three of the special service providers with master agreements. The department shall issue a contract service order for the work to the provider submitting the lowest quotation, except as provided below. In the event that the department is unable to obtain three quotations, the department head shall base the issuance of the contract service order on the quote or quotes received. If the department head believes that the public interest would best be served by accepting other than the lowest quotation, he or she is hereby authorized to accept the quotation that in his or her discretion will best serve the public interest. The department head may reject any and all quotations and request new quotations. \n(Added by Ord. 286-99, File No. 991645, App. 11/5/99; amended by Ord. 58-05, File No. 041571, App. 4/1/2005)\n\nSEC. 6.66.  CONVENTION FACILITY PUBLIC WORKS.\n     When construction work is required for the City-owned convention facilities, such services may be procured in accordance with the following procedures: \n     (A)     Bids will be requested from not fewer than three bidders for a construction contract. The contract will be awarded to the responsible bidder with the lowest responsive bid. A record of all bids received and a register of all awards made under this subsection shall be maintained. In the event three bids cannot be obtained, the award shall be based on the bid or bids received.

Department heads are particularly encouraged to utilize Clean Construction Comparative Bidding wherever the project is located within 500 feet of a Sensitive Site and the construction activity will occur for more than 20 days. The Department head or officer calling for bids shall specify in the Advertisement for Bids the monetary value that the Department will attribute to Clean Construction and shall evaluate responsive bids accordingly. Any contract awarded in consideration, in whole or in part, on the basis of Clean Construction Comparative Bidding shall include provisions (1) requiring the contractor to certify that all work has been undertaken in compliance with the requirements for Clean Construction set forth in Section \n6.25, (2) providing procedures to request a waiver of the biodiesel fuel and/or emissions standards as to specific, necessary equipment as set forth in Section \n6.2(b)(3)(D), and (3) providing for liquidated damages in the amount of $100.00 per day per vehicle operated at the project site in violation of Clean Construction standards.

The Department heads authorized to execute contracts for public work projects are authorized to seek proposals from qualified CM/GCs for construction of public work projects using an integrated project delivery under the following conditions: \n     (A)     Before the request for qualifications is issued, the Department head shall determine that an integrated project delivery is necessary or appropriate to achieve anticipated cost savings or time efficiencies, or both, and that such a process is in the public's best interest. \n     (B)     If the proposed public work project is for the use or benefit of a Department that is under the jurisdiction of a commission, then such commission shall first approve the solicitation of integrated project delivery proposals. If the public work is for the use or benefit of a Department not under the jurisdiction of a commission, then the City Administrator must first approve this process. \n     (C)     Pre-qualification. Department heads shall require that prospective proposers be pre-qualified to submit proposals on a specific project. The procedure for pre-qualification is as follows: \n          (1)     The Department head shall issue a request for qualifications inviting interested parties to submit their qualifications to perform the project. The request for qualifications shall include criteria by which the prospective proposers shall be evaluated. The evaluation criteria shall be based on qualifications and experience relevant to the services needed for the particular project. The list of criteria may include, but is not limited to the following: (i) ability to perform required pre-construction and construction phase services; (ii) evidence of financial capacity; (iii) experience on projects of similar size and complexity; (iv) commitment to comply with the goals and requirements of Administrative Code Chapters 12 and 14; (v) ability to collaboratively and cooperatively deliver projects on time and on budget; (vi) liquidated damages for delay and other damages paid on prior projects, and prior litigation history; (vii) reputation with owners of prior projects; (viii) claims history with insurance carriers and sureties; and (ix) compliance with all of the requirements established in the request for qualifications and other criteria that the Department head in consultation with the Human Rights Commission may deem appropriate. The Department head shall set objective scoring criteria and incorporate the criteria into any scoring procedure. \n          (2)     The Department head shall designate a panel to review pre-qualification responses and interview and rate respondents with respect to the request for qualifications. Only those respondents found to be qualified will be eligible to submit proposals. The list of pre-qualified respondents shall be valid for not more than two years following the date of initial pre-qualification. \n     (D)     Request for Proposals and Selection Process. The Department head shall issue a request for proposals inviting pre-qualified CM/GCs to submit competitive cost proposals for the project. The request for proposals shall include information describing the scope of pre-construction and construction phase services for the project. The request for proposals shall request the following minimum cost information from each proposer: (i) fees for pre-construction services and (ii) fees for construction phase services, including overhead, profit and general conditions, and (iii) the qualitative criteria as described in (1) below. \n          (1)     The Department head shall designate a panel to evaluate integrated project delivery proposals and rank the proposals to determine which provides the overall best value to the City with respect to non-cost and cost criteria. The list of non-cost criteria may include but is not limited to the following: (i) plan for expediency in completing the proposed project; (ii) quality of proposal; (iii) commitment to comply with the goals set by the Human Rights Commission and requirements of Administrative Code Chapters 12 and 14; (iv) commitment to meet City hiring goals (e.g. City Build or First Source Hiring); and (v) compliance with all the requirements and criteria established by the Department head or HRC in the request for proposals. The department head shall set objective scoring criteria and incorporate the criteria into any scoring procedure. The cost criterion shall constitute not less than sixty-five percent (65%) of the overall evaluation. \n          (2)     The Department head shall set forth in the request for proposals and in the contract liquidated damages to be assessed against the successful CM/GC in the event it fails to fulfill the commitments made in its proposal. \n          (3)     The Department head may recommend the award of a contract to the highest-ranked CM/GC whose total proposed fee is not more than twenty percent (20%) greater for contracts the estimated cost of which is $10 million or less, or is not more than ten percent (10%) greater for contracts the estimated cost of which is in excess of $10 million, than the total proposed fee of the lowest responsive bid. If award to such CM/GC is not made for any reason, the Department head may recommend the award of a contract to the next highest-ranked CM/GC whose total proposed fee is not more than ten percent (10%) greater than the total proposed fee of the lowest responsive bid, and so forth. In making the final determination, the Department head shall apply the LBE discount to proposals submitted by LBEs, in accordance with Administrative Code Chapter 14B. \n     (E)     Alternate Request for Proposals and Selection Process. If the department head determines that it is in the City's best interest to exclude consideration of non-cost criteria as part of the final selection process, the Department head shall issue a request for proposals inviting pre-qualified CM/GCs to submit integrated project delivery proposals, which will be evaluated based upon project costs only. If the proposed public work project is for the use or benefit of a Department that is under jurisdiction of a commission, then such commission shall approve the use of this alternate process. If the public work is for the use or benefit of a Department not under the jurisdiction of a commission, then the City Administrator must approve the use this alternate process. \n     (F)     The City shall retain the absolute discretion to determine, at any time during the process, not to proceed with any proposed project, which right may be exercised without liability to CM/GCs for costs incurred during the entire pre-qualification, proposal and negotiation process, and such rights shall be reserved in all requests for qualifications and proposals. \n     (G)     The bid security and subcontractor listing requirements of section \n6.21 will not apply to the selection of CM/GCs under this section \n6.68. Any resulting contract with a CM/GC shall comply with section \n6.22. \n     (H)     Procurement of Trade Subcontractors. Department heads shall require the selected CM/GC to procure trade work contracts through a pre-qualification and competitive bid process, as follows: \n          (1)     Pre-qualification. The department head shall require the CM/GC to pre-qualify all trade subcontractors, subject to the approval of the Department head. The CM/GC shall attempt to establish a pool of no fewer than three pre-qualified subcontractors for each trade package, subject to the approval of the department head. \n          (2)     Competitive Bid. The Department head shall require the CM/GC to receive sealed bids from the pre-qualified trade subcontractors. The bid security provisions of section \n6.21 will not apply. The CM/GC shall award a trade package subcontract to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest responsive bid, except that the CM/GC may negotiate and award a portion of the trade package subcontracts as provided in paragraph (3), below. Only those Administrative Code provisions that normally apply to subcontracts will apply to the trade package subcontracts. \n          (3)     The Department head may authorize the CM/GC to negotiate subcontracts for trade work as appropriate for the project, up to an amount not exceeding seven and one-half percent of the total estimated subcontract costs. The Department head shall establish a maximum dollar value for each negotiated trade subcontract as appropriate for the project. \n     (J)     All actions heretofore taken by a department head consistent with the provisions of this section are hereby approved.\n(Added by Ord. 119-08, File No. 080277, App. 7/11/2008; amended by Ord. 96-10, File No. 100332, App. 5/13/2010)\n\nSEC. 6.69.  DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PUBLIC WORK.\n     For public work necessary to maintain or repair health facilities under the jurisdiction of the Health Commission, the Department of Public Health (DPH) may award master agreement contracts, for work to be performed on an \"if-and-as-needed\" basis, to qualified construction contractors in conformance with the following procedures: \n     (A)     Contract Award.
