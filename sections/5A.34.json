By two-thirds vote of all its members, the Board by resolution may overturn the Committee's decision and remand the matter to the Committee for further consideration consistent with the views expressed by the Board in its resolution. \n     (c)     Alternatively, the Committee's prohibition on the issuance or sale of authorized but unissued or unsold revenue bonds may be vacated by two-thirds vote of all the members of the Board, if the PUC, in response to the report of the Committee, provides evidence of corrective measures satisfactory to the Board. \n(Added by Proposition P, 11/5/2002)\n\n","heading":{"title":"5A","chaptersection":"34. ","identifier":"5A.34. ","catch_text":"ILLEGAL EXPENDITURES."}}
