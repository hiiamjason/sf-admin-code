{"text":"\nLEGAL TEXT OF PROPOSITION I \n     Notice is hereby given by the persons whose names appear heron of their intention to circulate the petition with the City and County of San Francisco for the purpose of putting before the people of San Francisco for the November 8, 2005 election a declaration of policy stating that: \n     the people of San Francisco oppose U.S. military recruiters using public school, college and university facilities to recruit young people into the armed forces. Furthermore, San Francisco should oppose the military's \"economic draft\" by investigating means by which to fund and grant scholarships for college and job training to low-income students so they are not economically compelled to join the military. \n     A statement of the reasons of the proposed action as contemplated in the petition is as follows: \n     Whereas, over 1,500 American soldiers have died and tens of thousands have been injured physically and psychologically in Iraq; and, \n     Whereas, a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Columbia University School of Nursing and Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad estimates that 100,000 Iraqis have died as a result of the U.S. invasion and occupation; and, \n     Whereas, the U.S. government is forcing soldiers to serve in Iraq for longer than their contracts require with such devices as \"stop-loss\" orders; and, \n     Whereas, the \"No Child Left Behind Act\" forces all high schools that receive federal money to give personal records of all children to the military for the purposes of recruiting; and, \n     Whereas, the federal Solomon Amendment specifically orders colleges and universities that receive federal money to violate their own legal policies of non-discrimination against gays and lesbians by allowing recruiters for the military, which bars gays and lesbians from serving openly, on campus; and, \n     Whereas, a de facto \"economic draft\" forces tens of thousands of low and middle-income students to join the military in order to get money to go to college or get job or technical training; and, \n     Whereas, the Pentagon budget, over $400 billion per year, plus $300 billion more over the last three years for the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, is draining desperately needed resources for schools, health care and jobs; and, \n     Whereas, the people of San Francisco voted by 63% to pass Proposition N in November of 2004 calling on the Federal government to \"bring the troops safely home now;\" and, \n     Whereas, the Federal government shows no sign of ending the occupation of Iraq or bringing the troops safely home and, in fact, is threatening military action against other nations; now, therefore, be it \n     Resolved, that the people of San Francisco oppose U.S. military recruiters using public school, college and university facilities to recruit young people into the armed forces. Furthermore, San Francisco should oppose the military's \"economic draft\" by investigating means by which to fund and grant scholarships for college and job training to low-income students so they are not economically compelled to join the military. \n(Added by Proposition I, 11/8/2005)\n\n","heading":{"title":"74:","identifier":"74:","catch_text":"- POLICY INITIATIVE, U.S. MILITARY RECRUITERS IN SCHOOLS"}}
