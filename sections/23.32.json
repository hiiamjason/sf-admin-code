{"text":"\n     Any commission, board or department that, under the Charter or this Code, is given exclusive power to Lease Real Property under its control and management may submit any proposed Lease to the Director of Property for review and advisory recommendations and may request the Director of Property to determine fair market rental rates to aid and assist in negotiating, extending or renewing such Leases. It is the City's policy that all commissions, boards and departments that negotiate and administer such Leases submit all proposed Leases which have a term, including extension options, of five years or more, or which would produce more than $500,000 in revenue over such term, to the Director of Property for review and advisory recommendations before final approval of any such Lease and, as to such Leases, request the Director of Property to determine fair market rental rates to aid and assist in negotiating, extending or renewing such Leases. The purpose of this policy is to achieve greater consistency and coordination in the City's Leasing practices, to increase the financial return to the City from its Leases and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and expense in the Leasing of City Real Property. \n(Formerly Sec. 23.23; added by Ord. 323-86, App. 8/8/86; amended and renumbered by Ord. 15-01, File No. 001965, App. 2/2/2001; amended by Ord. 278-04, File No. 041352, App. 11/18/2004.
