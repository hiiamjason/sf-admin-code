{"text":"\n     (a)     The Board of Supervisors finds that funerals for active duty City employees who have died in the line of duty often become civic events and by their size and public nature can impose extraordinary costs and hardships upon the families of the deceased, making it appropriate for the City to contribute to the costs of these events. \n     (b)     The Director of Human Resources may authorize payment of some or all of the funeral expenses of active duty City employees whose death is caused by an injury sustained by the employee arising out of and in the course of his or her employment. The Controller may transfer funds to the Director of Human Resources for such purposes from any legally available source. \n     (c)     The Board intends that this Section be given retroactive effect so as to authorize contributions to funeral expenses incurred after July 1, 2006. \n(Added by Ord. 276-06, File No. 061167, App. 11/17/2006)\n\n","heading":{"title":"16","chaptersection":"7","identifier":"16.7","catch_text":"REIMBURSEMENT FOR FUNERAL COSTS."}}
