The Mayor shall identify all Selected Nonrecurring Revenues and their proposed uses in his or her June 1 budget submission. As part of the Controller's Opinion on Revenue Estimates required under Charter Section \n9.102, the Controller shall identify all Selected Nonrecurring Revenues included in the Mayor's budget submission and certify whether the proposed uses of those revenues constitute Nonrecurring Expenditures.\n     (d)     Temporary Suspension. The City, by a resolution of the Board of Supervisors adopted by a two-thirds' vote, may temporarily suspend the provisions of subsection (b) for the current or upcoming budget year. The Board of Supervisors may suspend these provisions following a natural disaster that has caused the Mayor or the Governor to declare an emergency, or for any other purpose.\n(Added by Ord. 235-11, File No. 110999, App. 12/1/2011, Eff. 12/31/2011, Oper. 6/1/2012)\n\n","heading":{"title":"10","chaptersection":"61. ","identifier":"10.61. ","catch_text":"USE OF SELECTED NONRECURRING REVENUES."}}
