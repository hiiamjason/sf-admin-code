The withholding, decrease, denial, discontinuance, and/or recoupment of overpayments of aid will, therefore, be effected. The applicant or recipient may, for good cause shown, make a written request, or oral request as specified in the Executive Director's Regulations, for a second hearing within 15 days of the scheduled date for the first hearing. \n     Such request must specify the good cause for nonattendance at the first hearing. This provision is satisfied by evidence of any of the following: (1) Verified hospitalization; (2) verified illness; (3) verified incarceration; or (4) verified disability or other good cause satisfactorily shown to the Executive Director. \n(Amended by Ord. 271-81, App. 5/21/81; Ord. 152-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\n","heading":{"title":"20","chaptersection":"60.9","identifier":"20.60.9","catch_text":"HEARING; FINALITY; EFFECT OF NONAPPEARANCE."}}
