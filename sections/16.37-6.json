No adjustments affecting teachers under the Retirement System shall be made on the basis of payment of teachers' salaries in other than 12 monthly installments; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prevent adjustments prior to termination of membership in the Retirement System, in contributions because of underpayments or overpayments of salary, nor shall it prevent the Retirement Board from modifying the method referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, in the event that teachers' salaries shall be paid in other than 12 monthly installments, but such modification shall apply only to City and County service rendered thereafter. \n(Amended by Ord. 299-64, App. 11/9/64)\n\n","heading":{"title":"16","chaptersection":"37-6","identifier":"16.37-6","catch_text":"CALCULATION OF SERVICE CREDIT."}}
