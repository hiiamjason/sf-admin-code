{"text":"\n     (a)     Establishment of Fund. The Public Health Laguna Honda Home Trust Fund is established as a category eight fund into which shall be placed deposits made by patients at Laguna Honda Home. \n     (b)     Use of Fund. Any patient at Laguna Honda Home may deposit in this trust fund any money received by and belonging to him or her, and may, except as herein otherwise provided, withdraw such deposits as needed for his or her personal incidental expenses or other purposes; provided, however, that every patient who is obligated to pay for his or her care as determined under the provisions of Section 151.1 of Article 3, Chapter V, Part II of the San Francisco Municipal Code, shall deposit monthly in the trust fund an amount not less than the sum so set for monthly repayment by him or her to Laguna Honda Home for the cost of such care. Any money deposited to the account of such patient in excess of the amount to be so paid for care may be withdrawn by the depositor at any time, for personal incidental needs or otherwise. At the end of such month, the amount to be paid to Laguna Honda Home for the patient's care shall be transferred from the trust fund and credited to Laguna Honda Home; and the patient's trust fund account shall be so charged. \n          Upon discharge or withdrawal of a patient from Laguna Honda Home, any unearned portion of the monthly charge for institutional care will be refunded to the patient, together with any and all other amounts on deposit in his or her name in the trust fund. \n          For the purpose of facilitating the withdrawal of moneys belonging to the patients, the Superintendent of Laguna Honda Home may maintain, as a part of the trust fund, a revolving fund in such amount as shall be authorized by the Health Commission with the concurrence of the Controller. Such revolving fund may be maintained in cash at the office of Laguna Honda Home or may be deposited in such bank or banks as the Superintendent of Laguna Honda Home may direct. \n     (c)     Administration of Fund. The Superintendent of Laguna Honda Home shall cause full, true and correct records to be maintained currently regarding the receipt and disbursement of all moneys belonging to any such patients on deposit in the Laguna Honda Home Trust Fund, and for that purpose shall maintain individual accounts for each such patient. \n(Added by Ord. 316-00, File No. 001911, App. 12/28/2000)\n\n","heading":{"title":"10","chaptersection":"100-209. ","identifier":"10.100-209. ","catch_text":"PUBLIC HEALTH LAGUNA HONDA HOME TRUST FUND."}}
