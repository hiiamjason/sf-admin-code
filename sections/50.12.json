The Director shall evaluate the types of security offered by each loan applicant and shall give preference to those types and amounts of security that in his or her opinion will provide the greatest protection for the City's funds.

Those types of security shall include, but are not limited to: \n     (a)     A deed of trust on the subject property, naming the City and County as beneficiary;\n     (b)     The guarantee of the owner of the subject property, in cases where the arts organization is the tenant of the property to be improved; \n     (c)     The independent, joint and several, collateral guarantee of the Board of Directors of an arts organization;\n     (d)     A chattel mortgage or financing statement on equipment or other personal property owned by the arts organization.\n(Added by Ord. 69-84, App. 2/15/84; amended by Ord. 160-91, App. 4/25/91)\n\nSEC. 50.25.  INSURANCE.\n     All loans made under this Chapter shall provide that the loan applicant shall maintain, throughout the term of the loan, fire and lightning insurance with an extended coverage endorsement and a vandalism and malicious mischief endorsement.
