{"text":"\n     (a)     For employees working for an employer on or before the operative date of this Chapter, paid sick leave shall begin to accrue as of the operative date of this Chapter. For employees hired by an employer after the operative date of this Chapter, paid sick leave shall begin to accrue 90 days after the commencement of employment with the employer. \n     (b)     For every 30 hours worked after paid sick leave begins to accrue for an employee, the employee shall accrue one hour of paid sick leave. Paid sick leave shall accrue only in hour-unit increments; there shall be no accrual of a fraction of an hour of paid sick leave. \n     (c)     For employees of small businesses, there shall be a cap of 40 hours of accrued paid sick leave. For employees of other employers, there shall be a cap of 72 hours of accrued paid sick leave. Accrued paid sick leave for employees carries over from year to year (whether calendar year or fiscal year), but is limited to the aforementioned caps. \n     (d)     If an employer has a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off policy, that makes available to employees an amount of paid leave that may be used for the same purposes as paid sick leave under this Chapter and that is sufficient to meet the requirements for accrued paid sick leave as stated in subsections (a)-(c), the employer is not required to provide additional paid sick leave. \n     (e)     An employer is not required to provide financial or other reimbursement to an employee upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment, for accrued paid sick leave that the employee has not used. \n(Added by Proposition F, 11/7/2006)\n\n","heading":{"title":"12W","chaptersection":"3","identifier":"12W.3","catch_text":"ACCRUAL OF PAID SICK LEAVE."}}
