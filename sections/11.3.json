{"text":"\n     Except as provided in Section \n11.4 below, no Person may construct, install, or operate Facilities in the Public Rights-of-Way, or provide Service using any Facilities installed in the Public Rights-of-Way, without a Franchise that authorizes each and every Service provided. Any Person using Facilities owned by another Person to provide Service, whether by lease or other arrangement, shall be required to obtain a Franchise pursuant to this Chapter. A Grantee may, at any time and pursuant to this Chapter, apply to expand the scope of its Franchise, subject to appropriate conditions, or apply for a separate Franchise to provide other Services. The fact that a Person uses Facilities to provide Service not requiring a Franchise does not obviate the need to obtain a Franchise where the Facilities are also used to provide other Services. \n(Added by Ord. 58-00, File No. 000198, App. 4/7/2000)\n\n","heading":{"title":"11","chaptersection":"3","identifier":"11.3","catch_text":"FRANCHISE REQUIRED."}}
