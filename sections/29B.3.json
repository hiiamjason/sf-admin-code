{"text":"\n     The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure that San Francisco is a leader in the provision of child care, that City agencies understand their employee's child care needs, and that any new demand for child care services that a proposed development project would generate is considered early in the project development process and included as part of the total project budget. This will enhance the performance and morale of City employees by offering the opportunity for quality child care in a City-owned or controlled space, and increase the availability of quality child care options in the City and County of San Francisco. \n(Added by Ord. 1-11, File No. 101094, App. 1/6/2011)\n\n","heading":{"title":"29B","chaptersection":"3","identifier":"29B.3","catch_text":"PURPOSE."}}
