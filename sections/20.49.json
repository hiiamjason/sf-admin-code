The program shall provide a portable subsidy for licensed early care and education to any eligible working family for the purposes of providing these services to any child ages 3 to 5. Nothing in this section is intended to preclude the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors from making subsides for licensed early care and education available to children between the ages of 0 and 2. \n(Added by Proposition I, 11/4/2003)\n\nSEC. 20.53-103.  SMART START FOR SAN FRANCISCO KIDS FUND.\n     There is hereby established a fund to be known as \"Smart Start for San Francisco Kids Fund,\" which shall contain all appropriations for the implementation of this ordinance.

In addition, with respect to each employable recipient, continuing aid shall be conditioned, at the option of the Department, upon either completion of 20 verifiable job applications per month and/or participation in a Department-approved job counseling, vocational rehabilitation, drug or alcohol treatment or work assignment program. Verifiable job applications or job searches within the meaning of this Section, Section \n20.58(c), and Section \n20.58.2(b)(5) of this Article, shall include, but not be limited to: (1) sending applications, resumes and cover letters to apply for available positions for which the recipient meets the minimum qualifications, with copies of these documents and the telephone number of the prospective employer provided to the Department of Human Services so they can be verified; and (2) participation by a union member in union hiring hall programs that make use of telephone job searches for currently available positions. \n     In addition, with respect to each unemployable recipient, continuing aid shall be conditioned upon application for, and pursuit of, SSI/SSP benefits, if eligible, and participation in a Department-approved rehabilitation program.

The Municipal Railway tokens shall be for the sole use of the recipient. \n     (d)     The Maximum General Assistance Grant Amounts listed in Section \n20.57 (a) of this ordinance shall be increased by any annual percentage cost of living increase to the Maximum Aid Payment, and according to the same schedule, if such an increase is implemented by the State of California in the TANF/CalWORKs program. \n     (e)     The maximum monthly amount of aid for which an applicant is eligible shall be the Maximum General Assistance Grant Amount prorated as of the eligibility determination date, minus any nonexempt assets and/or nonexempt personal property available to the applicant during that calendar month, and minus the value of any prorated in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the applicant. Rent, retroactive to the first of the month in which eligibility was determined, may be authorized to prevent eviction from existing housing. Applicants who anticipate receiving first-time income from other sources during the month of their application for General Assistance, shall receive the prorated maximum monthly grant amount for which they are eligible until the verified date of anticipated receipt of such other income. \n     (f)     The maximum monthly amount of aid for which a recipient is eligible shall be the Maximum General Assistance Grant Amount, or the amount determined pursuant to Subsection (b) minus any cash received from sources other than General Assistance which is or will be available to the recipient during the month for which aid is paid unless otherwise exempt, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property which is or will be available to the recipient during the month for which aid is paid, and minus the value of any in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the recipient. \n     (g)     No grant shall be issued for less than $5.\n     (h)     To promote the transition of General Assistance recipients to gainful employment, the Executive Director of the Department of Human Services may establish an Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program for the recipients who are employed. The Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program shall provide for disregarding a certain amount of gross income which a recipient earns as wages and savings derived therefrom when determining a recipient's General Assistance Program eligibility and grant amount. The total amount of gross income disregarded shall not exceed the sum of the following amounts: (1) all of the first $200 of recipient gross wage earnings; (2) two-thirds of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (3) one-half of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (4) one-third of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; and (5) one-fifth of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings. All recipient gross wage earnings above $800 shall be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis against the grant amount to which a recipient would otherwise be entitled. In addition, for recipients participating in this program up to $2,000 of recipient savings derived from the recipient's gross wage earnings shall be disregarded during the recipient's participation in this program and for up to three months thereafter. Also, if as a result of retrospective budgeting a recipient's total currently available financial resources in a month including his or her adjusted General Assistance grant, wages, and savings are less than the maximum General Assistance grant amount, the recipient shall be eligible for a grant supplement in the form of a rental expense voucher for unpaid rent in that month and up to $50 in cash so that the recipient's currently available financial resources may total up to the maximum General Assistance grant amount. This grant supplement is available a maximum of three times per year for program participants and is not available to recipients who quit a job without good cause. \n     Recipient gross wage earnings are defined for purposes of this Section as any income received by the recipient as payment for a recipient's labor. This Section supersedes the provisions of Subsection \n20.55.2(r), Section \n20.56.6, Subsections \n20.56.10 (a) and (b), Subsections \n20.57 (e) and (f), and Subsections \n20.59.10 (d), (e) and (f) when determining recipient eligibility and when calculating the maximum monthly amount of aid for program participants. All other recipient income and assets shall continue to be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis when calculating the grant amount to which a recipient is otherwise eligible. For recipients participating in this program, General Assistance eligibility shall be determined on a monthly basis and a recipient's grant amount shall be adjusted for gross wage earnings on the basis of retrospective budgeting in the month following the recipient's receipt of wage income. Verified expenses which exceed the total sum of a participant's grant, wages, and savings in any given month create a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for aid. \n     (i)     The automatic adjustment provisions of Subsection (d) are hereby suspended for fiscal year 1997-98. Adjustments for subsequent fiscal years made pursuant to this Section shall not include any adjustments for any fiscal year in which the cost of living was suspended. \n(Amended by Ord. 271-81, App. 5/21/81; Ord. 253-90, App. 6/29/90; Ord. 389-90, App. 12/6/90; Ord. 125-93, App. 4/30/93; Ord. 206-94, App. 5/27/94; Ord. 419-94, App. 12/23/94; Ord. 155-95, App. 5/12/95; Ord. 196-96, App. 5/22/96; Ord. 209-97, App. 5/30/97; Ord. 152-98, App. 5/8/98; Proposition N, 11/5/2002; Ord. 193-03, File No. 030871, App. 7/25/2003) \n\nSEC. 20.57.1.  HOUSING.\n     (a)     \"Housing\" shall mean single occupancy residential hotels, master lease rooms, transitional housing, supportive housing programs, or residential substance abuse and mental health treatment facilities. \n     (b)     There shall be no reduction in the amount of General Assistance for which an applicant or recipient is eligible because he or she shares housing with others who are not members of the applicant's family as defined in Section \n20.57(a).

The value of the rent-free housing, which is presumed to include utilities, as determined under the Income-in-Kind Chart, shall be deducted from the maximum monthly grant amount.

This presumption may be rebutted by satisfactory evidence being presented to the Executive Director pursuant to Department regulations that the recipient is disabled for a period less than 12 months or, in the Department's determination, the recipient is unable to seek or obtain employment. Denial of SSI/SSP in and of itself shall not be grounds for denial of General Assistance.

Under such a program, notwithstanding Section \n20.59.4(b), the Department may pay housing costs for an applicant or recipient directly to the housing provider, or a third party, with whom the Department may contract, on behalf of the housing provider. Such direct rent payment shall be deducted from the maximum General Assistance grant amount, as specified in this Article, for which an applicant or recipient is eligible. The Department shall adopt regulations to provide a mechanism for payment to the applicant or recipient the balance of any grant amount to which he or she is entitled and may adopt additional regulations as necessary to implement this program. \n     For purposes of this Section, the Department may adopt regulations to define \"housing\" which would qualify for this program to include, but not be limited to, public and private rental housing, supportive housing managed by community organizations or public agencies, transitional housing, or other means of accommodation as determined appropriate by the Executive Director, and which conforms to applicable health, building and safety codes. \n     Refusal to accept placement in housing provided under this program, subject to the provisions of Section \n20.57.1(b) of this Article, constitutes grounds for denial or discontinuance of aid. \n(Amended by Ord. 212-80, App. 5/16/80; amended by Proposition N, 11/8/94; Ord. 152-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.59.3.  AID PAYMENTS; IN-KIND AID.\n     Assistance in the form of in-kind benefits, in-kind orders, electronic benefit transfers, or emergency checks shall be used: \n     (a)     As aid payments.\n     (b)     For applicants and recipients who declare themselves to be homeless.

A rent payment, retroactive to the first of the month in which eligibility is determined, may be authorized to prevent eviction from existing housing. \n     (c)     The maximum monthly PAES stipend for which a participant is eligible shall be the maximum PAES stipend minus any nonexempt cash received from sources other than PAES which is available to the participant during the month for which the stipend is paid, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property which is, or will be, available to the participant during the month for which the stipend is paid, and minus the value of any in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the participant. \n     (d)     No PAES stipend shall be issued for less than $5.00.\n     (e)     PAES assistance and stipends may be provided in the form of vouchers, checks, two-party checks, warrants, electronic benefit transfers, in-kind benefits, and/or through third party contracts. \n     (f)     PAES stipends may be made payable only to the participant or, upon the participant's written authorization, to the participant and a designated co-payee, or to a representative payee. \n     (g)     PAES stipends may be mailed directly to the participant or to the designated representative payee.

Self-declared homeless applicants and recipients shall receive in-kind benefits for housing, utilities and meals. If in-kind benefits are not available, such applicants and recipients shall receive the income-in-kind value of housing, utilities, and/or meals, whichever is not available, if otherwise eligible for these amounts. Failure to comply with the rules of a housing program that results in ejection from that housing program will be considered failure to satisfy the requirements for continuing eligibility for aid and will result in discontinuance from PAES, subject to the notice and hearing provisions of this Article. \n     (k)     A special allowance of up to $59.00 per month shall be made available to any recipient when the income-in-kind value of housing, and/or utilities, and/or meals provided to that recipient exceeds the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible. If such income-in-kind value does not exceed the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible, but allows for less than $59.00 cash per month, that recipient shall receive an amount that, when added to the maximum monthly stipend for which that recipient is eligible, equals $59.00 cash per month. This section shall not affect the collection of overpayments due to fraud, negligent failure to report facts or administrative error as set forth in this Article. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002; Ord. 93-07, File No. 070208, App. 4/27/2007)\n\nSEC. 20.76.1.  MUNICIPAL RAILWAY FAST PASS.\n     Participants may be provided a Municipal Railway Fast Pass, Municipal Railway tokens, or other transportation assistance when such transportation is necessary to assist the participant in complying with the requirements of this Article.

The Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program shall provide for disregarding a certain amount of gross income that a participant earns as wages and savings derived therefrom when determining a participant's PAES eligibility and stipend amount. \n     (b)     The total amount of gross income disregarded shall not exceed the sum of the following amounts: (1) all of the first $200 of participant gross wage earnings; (2) two-thirds of the next $150 of participant gross wage earnings; (3) one-half of the next $150 of participant gross wage earnings; (4) one-third of the next $150 of participant gross wage earnings; and (5) one-fifth of the next $150 of participant gross wage earnings. All participant gross wage earnings above $800 shall be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis against the stipend amount to which a participant would otherwise be entitled. \n     (c)     In addition, for participants in this program, up to $2,000 of participant savings derived from the participant's gross wage earnings shall be disregarded during the individual participant's participation in this program and for up to three months thereafter. \n     (d)     If, as a result of retrospective budgeting, a participant's total currently available financial resources in a month including her/his adjusted PAES stipend, wages, and savings are less than the maximum PAES stipend amount, the participant shall be eligible for a stipend supplement in the form of a rental expense voucher for unpaid rent in that month and up to $50 in cash so that the participant's currently available financial resources may total up to the maximum PAES stipend amount. This stipend supplement is available a maximum of three times per year for program participants and is not available to participants who quit a job without good cause. \n     (e)     Participant gross wage earnings are defined for purposes of this Section as any income received by the participant as payment for a participant's labor. All other participant income and assets shall continue to be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis when calculating the stipend amount to which a participant is otherwise eligible. For individuals participating in this program, the PAES stipend amount shall be adjusted for gross wage earnings on the basis of retrospective budgeting in the month following the participant's receipt of wage income. Verified expenses that exceed the total sum of a participant's stipend, wages, and savings in any given month create a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for assistance. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.76.3.  HOUSING.\n     (a)     \"Housing\" shall include, but not be limited to, single occupancy residential hotels, master lease rooms, transitional housing, supportive housing programs, residential treatment facilities, shelter. \n     (b)     There shall be no reduction in the PAES stipend for which an applicant/participant is eligible because s/he shares housing with others who are not members of the applicant's/participant's family budget unit as defined under this Article. All applicants/participants shall be required to present a verifiable rent receipt. If the applicant/participant is not the owner or prime lessee of the premises, a verifiable rent receipt signed by the owner or prime lessee may provide evidence of the applicant's/participant's place of residence and monthly share of housing costs. \n     (c)     When an applicant/participant obtains rent-free housing, such housing shall be valued according to Income-in-Kind Values Chart set forth under Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 50511 (the Income-in-Kind Chart\"), rather than at fair market value. The value of the rent-free housing, which is presumed to include utilities, as determined under the Income-in-Kind Chart, shall be deducted from the maximum monthly stipend amount. If the applicant or recipient receives rent-free housing, but pays for utilities, the applicant or recipient must present a verifiable bill for utilities at that address, and a verifiable receipt for payment of any portion of that utility bill. \n     (d)     Verified payments made directly to a housing provider on behalf of an applicant/participant for the entire amount of the rent and/or utilities, or rent-free housing, or housing received in exchange for work, shall be assigned an in-kind value as specified by the Income-in-Kind Chart and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly stipend for which that applicant/participant is eligible. \n     (e)     Housing and/or meals provided to applicants and recipients who are unable to provide a verifiable rent receipt, or verifiable documentation of shared housing, or verifiable documentation of rent-free housing shall be valued as in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals as specified by the Income-In-kind Chart, and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly stipend for which that applicant or recipient is eligible. \n     (f)     Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring an otherwise eligible applicant/participant to accept housing in a facility which is either the subject of a pending nuisance abatement proceeding before a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or before a court of competent jurisdiction, or which theretofore has been found to be a public nuisance pursuant to any provision of any San Francisco Municipal Code by a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or by a court of competent jurisdiction and which nuisance has not been abated. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002)\n\nSEC. 20.76.4.  ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS; DIRECT PAYMENTS TO ROOM AND BOARD FACILITIES PERMITTED.\n     In addition to the emergency aid provisions of this Article, payment for room, food expense, or both, up to the maximum PAES stipend amount, may at the applicant's/participant's option, be paid directly to any board and/or-care facility should the applicant/participant choose to reside, take her/his meals or have full room and board privileges at such facilities. The Executive Director may initiate such a program or payment arrangement, on either a pilot or continuing basis, by putting into effect the appropriate regulations. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.76.5.  SPECIAL ALLOWANCES; TRANSPORTATION OUT OF THE CITY.\n     (a)     The Department of Human Services may provide transportation and maintenance en route to a place out of the City and County where the applicant/participant will be cared for or her/his interests best served, provided the applicant/participant, but for fully meeting the residency requirement, is otherwise eligible and voluntarily enters into a signed contractual agreement regarding such transportation with the City and County of San Francisco. Said agreement shall contain a repayment provision permitting recoupment of the amount expended in providing such transportation at a rate not to exceed 10 percent of each stipend amount should the person provided transportation thereafter reapply and become eligible for PAES. \n     (b)     Transportation under this Section shall be provided by the least expensive means available.\n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.76.6.  EMPLOYER WAGE SUBSIDY - PAES PROGRAM.\n     (a)     Findings. The Board of Supervisors in adopting this ordinance finds that providing the authority for the Department of Human Services to establish a wage subsidy program as defined herein will promote the permanent employment of PAES participants. \n     (b)     Employer Wage Subsidy For the purposes of this Section, \"employer wage subsidy\" means a payment from revenues appropriated for a PAES participant to an employer for a PAES participant who becomes employed through this program and is employed for at least 26 weeks and earns a minimum of $800 per month in gross wage earnings. \n     (c)     Wage SubsidySchedule. A wage subsidy payment shall only be issued to an employer by the Department of Human Services upon receipt of documentation of gross wage earnings paid to a participant of the program by the employer for the first 26 weeks of employment, except when the payment of a wage subsidy in two installments is approved by the Executive Director. A wage subsidy payment issued to an employer in two installments shall only be issued by the Department of Human Services upon receipt of documentation of gross wage earnings paid to the participant by the employer for 13 consecutive weeks of employment and the second payment shall only be issued upon receipt of documentation of gross wage earnings paid to the same participant by the employer for an additional 13 consecutive weeks of employment. \n     (d)     Amount of Subsidy. The employer wage subsidy shall not exceed an amount that is 14 percent of the participant's monthly gross wage earnings and shall not exceed in any month the maximum amount of a PAES stipend for which the participant would otherwise be eligible. A wage subsidy shall not be paid to an employer for more than the first 26 weeks of employment. Participant \"gross wage earnings\" are defined for purposes of this Section as income received by the participant as payment for the participant's labor. \n     (e)     Authority. The Department of Human Services may utilize an employer wage subsidy to encourage employers to hire qualified PAES participants as full-time employees. The Department shall make reasonable efforts to coordinate with community agencies that provide job search services to implement these provisions. \n     (f)     Program Administration. Prior to the Department's implementation of this authority, the Executive Director shall establish procedures and regulations for the proper administration of this authority. The regulations shall include a prohibition against the payment of a subsidy under this program for placing PAES participants in positions in which they would be replacing striking employees. \n     (g)     Report. The Executive Director of the Department of Human Services shall report to the Human Services Commission about the results of the Department's implementation of the program one year from the effective date of this ordinance, and annually thereafter. \n(Added by Ord. 150-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.77.  CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY.\n     (a)     Persons who meet the requirements for eligibility for PAES shall receive cash stipends pursuant to this Article.

For family budget units in which members receive cash payments from more than one federal, State or County assistance program, except for SSI/SSP, the total aid payment shall consist of the sum of each individual's proportionate share of the aid payment for a family budget unit of the same size within each program to which each member is eligible. \n     (b)     The maximum monthly CALM payment for which an applicant is eligible shall be the maximum monthly CALM payment prorated as of the eligibility determination date, minus any nonexempt cash available to the applicant during that calendar month, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property available to the applicant during that calendar month, and minus the value of any prorated in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the applicant. A rent payment, retroactive to the first of the month in which eligibility is determined, may be authorized to prevent eviction from existing housing. \n     (c)     The maximum monthly CALM payment for which a recipient is eligible shall be the maximum CALM payment minus any nonexempt cash received from sources other than CALM which is available to the recipient during the month for which assistance is paid, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property which is, or will be, available to the recipient during the month for which assistance is paid, and minus the value of any in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the applicant. \n     (d)     No CALM payment shall be issued for less than $5.00.\n     (e)     CALM may be provided in the form of vouchers, checks, two-party checks, warrants, electronic benefit transfers, in-kind benefits, and/or through third party contracts. \n     (f)     CALM payments may be made payable only to the recipient or, upon the recipient's written authorization, to the recipient and a designated co-payee, or to a representative payee. \n     (g)     CALM payments may be mailed directly to the recipient or to the designated representative payee. CALM payments may be made by electronic benefit transfer. CALM payments may be picked up at a location designated by the Department. CALM payments shall not be mailed to a post office box, a mail receiving service, or to an address outside the City and County of San Francisco, except upon specific authorization of the Executive Director. \n     (h)     The Maximum CALM Payment Amounts listed in Section 20.106(a) of this Article shall be increased by any annual percentage cost of living increase to the Maximum Aid Payment, and according to the same schedule, if such an increase is implemented by the State of California in the TANF/CalWORKs program. \n     (i)     Applicants and recipients are required to provide a verifiable rent receipt, or verifiable documentation of shared housing, or verifiable documentation of rent-free housing. Self-declared homeless applicants and recipients shall receive in-kind benefits for housing, which includes utilities and meals. If in-kind benefits are not available, such applicants and recipients shall receive the income-in-kind value of housing, utilities, and/or meals, whichever is not available, if otherwise eligible for these amounts. Failure to comply with the rules of a housing program that results in ejection from that housing program will be considered failure to satisfy the requirements for continuing eligibility for aid and will result in discontinuance from CALM, subject to the notice and hearing provisions of this Article. \n     (j)     A special allowance of up to $59.00 per month shall be made available to any recipient when the income-in-kind value of housing, and/or utilities, and/or meals provided to that recipient exceeds the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible. If such income-in-kind value does not exceed the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible, but allows for less than $59.00 cash per month, that recipient shall receive an amount that, when added to the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible, equals $59.00 cash per month. This section shall not affect the collection of overpayments due to fraud, negligent failure to report facts or administrative error as set forth in this Article. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002; Ord. 93-07, File No. 070208, App. 4/27/2007)\n\nSEC. 20.106.1.  EARNED INCOME DISREGARD.\n     (a)     The Executive Director of the Department of Human Services may establish an Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program for recipients who are employed. The Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program shall provide for disregarding a certain amount of gross income which a recipient earns as wages and savings derived therefrom when determining a recipient's CALM eligibility and grant amount. \n     (b)     The total amount of gross income disregarded shall not exceed the sum of the following amounts: (1) all of the first $200 of recipient gross wage earnings; (2) two-thirds of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (3) one-half of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (4) one-third of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; and (5) one-fifth of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings. All recipient gross wage earnings above $800 shall be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis against the grant amount to which a recipient would otherwise be entitled. \n     (c)     In addition, for recipients in this program, up to $2,000 of recipient savings derived from the recipient's gross wage earnings shall be disregarded during the individual recipient's participation in this program and for up to three months thereafter. \n     (d)     If, as a result of retrospective budgeting, a recipient's total currently available financial resources in a month including her/his adjusted CALM grant, wages, and savings are less than the maximum CALM grant, the recipient shall be eligible for a grant supplement in the form of a rental expense voucher for unpaid rent in that month and up to $50 in cash so that the recipient's currently available financial resources may total up to the maximum CALM grant amount. This grant supplement is available a maximum of three times per year for program recipients and is not available to recipients who quit a job without good cause. \n     (e)     Recipient gross wage earnings are defined for purposes of this Section as any income received by the recipient as payment for a recipient's labor. All other recipient income and assets shall continue to be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis when calculating the grant amount to which a recipient is otherwise eligible. For individuals participating in this program, the CALM grant amount shall be adjusted for gross wage earnings on the basis of retrospective budgeting in the month following the recipient's receipt of wage income. Verified expenses which exceed the total sum of a recipient's grant, wages, and savings in any given month create a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for assistance. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.106.2.  HOUSING.\n     (a)     \"Housing\" shall include, but not be limited to, single occupancy residential hotels, master lease rooms, transitional housing, supportive housing programs, residential treatment facilities, shelter. \n     (b)     There shall be no reduction in the CALM payment for which an applicant/recipient is eligible because she/he shares housing with others who are not members of the applicant's family budget unit as defined under this Article. All applicants/recipients shall be required to present a verifiable rent receipt. If the applicant/recipient is not the owner or prime lessee of the premises, a verifiable rent receipt signed by the owner or prime lessee may provide evidence of the applicant's/recipient's place of residence and monthly share of housing costs. \n     (c)     When an applicant obtains rent-free housing, such housing shall be valued according to Value of Income-in-Kind Chart set forth under Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 50511 (the \"Income-in-Kind Chart\"), rather than at fair market value. The value of the rent-free housing, which is presumed to include utilities, as determined under the Income-in-Kind Chart, shall be deducted from the maximum monthly payment amount. If the applicant or recipient receives rent-free housing, but pays for utilities, the applicant or recipient must present a verifiable bill for utilities at that address, and a verifiable receipt for payment of any portion of that utility bill. \n     (d)     Verified payments made directly to a housing provider on behalf of an applicant or recipient for the entire amount of the rent and/or utilities, or rent-free housing, or housing received in exchange for work, shall be assigned an in-kind value as specified by the Income-in-Kind Chart and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly payment for which that applicant or recipient is eligible. \n     (e)     Housing and/or meals provided to applicants and recipients who are unable to provide a verifiable rent receipt, or verifiable documentation of shared housing, or verifiable documentation of rent-free housing shall be valued as in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals as specified by the Income-In-Kind Chart, and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly grant for which that applicant or recipient is eligible. \n     (f)     Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring an otherwise eligible applicant or recipient to accept housing in a facility which is either the subject of a pending nuisance abatement proceeding before a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or before a court of competent jurisdiction, or which theretofore has been found to be a public nuisance pursuant to any provision of any San Francisco Municipal Code by a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or by a court of competent jurisdiction and which nuisance has not been abated. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002)\n\nSEC. 20.106.3.  ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS; DIRECT PAYMENTS TO ROOM AND BOARD FACILITIES PERMITTED.\n     In addition to the emergency aid provisions of this Article, payment for room, food expense, or both, up to the CALM Grant Amount, may at the applicant's/recipient's option, be paid directly to any board and/or care facility should the applicant/recipient choose to reside, take her/his meals or have full room and board privileges at such facilities. The Executive Director may initiate such a program or payment arrangement, on either a pilot or continuing basis, by putting into effect the appropriate regulations. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.106.4.  SPECIAL ALLOWANCES; TRANSPORTATION OUT OF THE CITY.\n     (a)     The Department of Human Services may provide transportation and maintenance en route to a place out of the City and County where the applicant/recipient will be cared for or her/his interests best served, provided the applicant/recipient, but for fully meeting the residency requirement, is otherwise eligible and voluntarily enters into a signed contractual agreement regarding such transportation with the City and County of San Francisco. Said agreement shall contain a repayment provision permitting recoupment of the amount expended in providing such transportation at a rate not to exceed 10 percent of each payment amount should the person provided transportation thereafter reapply and become eligible for CALM. \n     (b)     Transportation under this Section shall be provided by the least expensive means available.\n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.107.  CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY.\n     (a)     Persons who meet the requirements for eligibility for CALM shall receive cash payments pursuant to this Article. Recipients are required to comply with all applicable provisions of this Article and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Recipients who fail to comply with applicable provisions of this Article and the regulations promulgated thereunder may have their assistance withheld and/or decreased and/or discontinued as set forth in Department regulations. \n     (b)     No withholding, decrease, or discontinuance of assistance shall occur unless the person to be affected has been advised of the possibility of such action by means of a Notice of Proposed Action and has been afforded the opportunity for a hearing to dispute the proposed action. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.107.1.  COMPLIANCE WITH MEDI-CAL REGULATIONS.\n     Continuing eligibility for CALM shall be dependent upon continuing eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits for the aged or disabled. All recipients of CALM payments must comply with all applicable Medi-Cal regulations. Termination of Medi-Cal eligibility terminates eligibility for CALM. Any individual who is no longer eligible for CALM may apply for General Assistance, PAES, SSIP or any other federal, State or County-funded cash assistance program in accordance with the rules and regulations of that program. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.108.  TIMING OF CALM PAYMENTS.\n     (a)     Emergency Assistance.

Discontinuance of assistance due to the death of the recipient, or at the request of the applicant/recipient is subject to the notice provisions of Section \n20.115(a); however, such discontinuances do not require 10 calendar day prior notice as specified in Section \n20.115(b). All other discontinuances under this Section do require 10 calendar day prior notice as specified in Section \n20.115(b). \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.111.  CHANGES IN CALM PAYMENTS.\n     (a)     Changes in cash payments shall be made when a CALM recipient becomes eligible for a payment in a different amount because of altered circumstances. \n     (b)     A change in payment shall be made effective with the next regular pay date following knowledge by the worker of circumstances warranting a change in payment, in conformance with the notice and hearing requirements of this Article. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.112.  LOST, FORGED OR STOLEN WARRANTS AND LOST OR STOLEN WARRANT PROCEEDS.\n     (a)     Lost, forged, or stolen warrants may be replaced only in accordance with specific procedures adopted by the Department.\n     (b)     If a warrant has been cashed by the recipient and the money lost or stolen, no replacement of the warrant or issuance of orders shall be permitted. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.113.  INELIGIBILITY FOR GENERAL ASSISTANCE, PAES, SSIP OR OTHER COUNTY-FUNDED ASSISTANCE.\n     Recipients of CALM payments are not eligible for General Assistance, PAES, SSIP or any other County-funded cash assistance programs. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.114.  DISCONTINUANCE FROM THE MEDI-CAL PROGRAM.\n     If a CALM recipient who has been discontinued from Medi-Cal decides to appeal that action, and continues to receive Medi-Cal benefits pending that appeal, that individual shall also continue to receive CALM payments pending the final administrative decision regarding discontinuance of Medi-Cal benefits. If the discontinuance from Medi-Cal is upheld, the Department may not collect any CALM payments pending, unless ineligibility for Medi-Cal is due to fraud. \n(Added by Ord. 149-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.115.  NOTICE OF PROPOSED ACTION.\n     (a)     The Department shall issue a Notice of Proposed Action whenever it intends to deny, withhold, decrease or discontinue CALM payments.

For family budget units in which members receive cash payments from more than one federal, State or County assistance program, except for SSI/SSP, the total aid payment shall consist of the sum of each individual's proportionate share of the aid payment for a family budget unit of the same size within each program for which each member is eligible. \n     (b)     The maximum monthly SSIP payment for which an applicant is eligible shall be the maximum monthly SSIP payment prorated as of the eligibility determination date, minus any nonexempt cash available to the applicant during that calendar month, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property available to the applicant during that calendar month, and minus the value of any prorated in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the applicant. A rent payment, retroactive to the first of the month in which eligibility is determined, may be authorized to prevent eviction from existing housing. \n     (c)     The maximum monthly SSIP payment for which a recipient is eligible shall be the maximum SSIP payment minus any nonexempt cash received from sources other than SSIP which is available to the recipient during the month for which the SSIP payment is paid, minus the fair market value of any nonexempt personal property which is, or will be, available to the recipient during the month for which the SSIP payment is paid, and minus the value of any in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals available or provided to the recipient. \n     (d)     No SSIP payment shall be issued for less than $5.00.\n     (e)     SSIP may be provided in the form of vouchers, checks, two-party checks, warrants, electronic benefit transfers, in-kind benefits, and/or through third party contracts. \n     (f)     SSIP payments may be made payable only to the recipient or, upon the recipient's written authorization, to the recipient and a designated co-payee, or to a representative payee. \n     (g)     SSIP payments may be mailed directly to the recipient or to the designated representative payee.

Self-declared homeless applicants and recipients shall receive in-kind benefits for housing, utilities and meals. If in-kind benefits are not available, such applicants and recipients shall receive the income-in-kind value of housing, utilities, and/or meals; whichever is not available, if otherwise eligible for these amounts. Failure to comply with the rules of a housing program that results in ejection from that housing program will be considered failure to satisfy the requirements for continuing eligibility for aid and will result in discontinuance from SSIP, subject to the notice and hearing provisions of this Article. \n     (j)     A special allowance of up to $59.00 per month shall be made available to any recipient when the income-in-kind value of housing, and/or utilities, and/or meals provided to that recipient exceeds the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible. If such income-in-kind value does not exceed the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible, but allows for less than $59.00 cash per month, that recipient shall receive an amount that, when added to the maximum monthly payment for which that recipient is eligible, equals $59.00 cash per month. This section shall not affect the collection of overpayments due to fraud, negligent failure to report facts or administrative error as set forth in this Article. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002; Ord. 93-07, File No. 070208, App. 4/27/2007)\n\nSEC. 20.206.1.  MUNICIPAL RAILWAY TOKENS.\n     Applicants/recipients may be provided Municipal Railway tokens, or other transportation assistance. Such assistance shall be in addition to any SSIP payment to which an applicant/recipient is eligible. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.206.2.  EARNED INCOME DISREGARD.\n     (a)     The Executive Director of the Department of Human Services may establish an Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program for applicants/recipients who are employed. The Earned Income and Asset Disregard Program shall provide for disregarding a certain amount of gross income which an applicant/recipient earns as wages and savings derived therefrom when determining an applicant/recipient's SSIP eligibility and payment amount. \n     (b)     The total amount of gross income disregarded shall not exceed the sum of the following amounts: (1) all of the first $200 of recipient gross wage earnings; (2) two-thirds of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (3) one-half of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; (4) one-third of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings; and (5) one-fifth of the next $150 of recipient gross wage earnings. All recipient gross wage earnings above $800 shall be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis against the payment amount to which an applicant/recipient would otherwise be entitled. \n     (c)     In addition, for applicant/recipients in this program up to $2,000 of applicant/recipient savings derived from the applicant/recipient's gross wage earnings shall be disregarded during the applicant/recipient's participation in this program and for up to three months thereafter. \n     (d)     If, as a result of retrospective budgeting, an applicant/recipient's total currently available financial resources in a month including her/his adjusted SSIP payment, wages, and savings are less than the maximum SSIP payment amount, the applicant/recipient shall be eligible for a payment supplement in the form of a rental expense voucher for unpaid rent in that month and up to $50 in cash so that the applicant/recipient's currently available financial resources may total up to the maximum SSIP payment amount. This payment supplement is available a maximum of three times per year for program applicants/recipients and is not available to applicants/recipients who quit a job without good cause. \n     (e)     Applicant/recipient gross wage earnings are defined for purposes of this Section as any income received by the applicant/recipient as payment for an applicant/recipient's labor. All other applicant/recipient income and assets shall continue to be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis when calculating the payment amount to which an applicant/recipient is otherwise eligible. For recipients participating in this program, SSIP eligibility shall be determined on a monthly basis and an applicant/recipient's payment amount shall be adjusted for gross wage earnings on the basis of retrospective budgeting in the month following the applicant/recipient's receipt of wage income. Verified expenses which exceed the total sum of an applicant/recipient's payment, wages, and savings in any given month create a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for assistance. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.206.3.  HOUSING.\n     (a)     \"Housing\" shall include, but not be limited to, single occupancy residential hotels, master lease rooms, transitional housing, supportive housing programs, residential treatment facilities, shelter. \n     (b)     There shall be no reduction in the SSIP payment for which an applicant or recipient is eligible because she/he shares housing with others who are not members of the applicant's/recipient's family budget unit. All applicants/recipients shall be required to present a verifiable rent receipt. If the applicant/recipient is not the owner or prime lessee of the premises, a verifiable rent receipt signed by the owner or prime lessee may provide evidence of the applicant's/recipient's place of residence and share of monthly housing costs. \n     (c)     When an applicant/recipient obtains rent-free housing, such housing shall be valued according to the Income-in-Kind Values Chart set forth under Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 50511 (the \"Income-in-Kind Chart\"), rather than at fair market value. The value of the rent-free housing, which is presumed to include utilities, as determined under the Income-in-Kind Chart, shall be deducted from the maximum monthly payment amount. If the applicant or recipient receives rent-free housing, but pays for utilities, the applicant or recipient must present a verifiable bill for utilities at that address, and a verifiable receipt for payment of any portion of that utility bill. \n     (d)     Verified payments made directly to a housing provider on behalf of an applicant or recipient for the entire amount of the rent and/or utilities, or rent-free housing, or housing received in exchange for work, shall be assigned an in-kind value as specified by the Income-in-Kind Chart and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly payment for which that applicant or recipient is eligible. \n     (e)     Housing and/or meals provided to applicants and recipients who are unable to provide a verifiable rent receipt, or verifiable documentation of shared housing, or verifiable documentation of rent-free housing shall be valued as in-kind housing, utilities and/or meals as specified by the Income-In-Kind Chart, and that value shall be deducted from the maximum monthly stipend for which that applicant or recipient is eligible. \n     (f)     Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring an otherwise eligible applicant or recipient to accept housing in a facility which is either the subject of a pending nuisance abatement proceeding before a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or before a court of competent jurisdiction, or which theretofore has been found to be a public nuisance pursuant to any provision of any San Francisco Municipal Code by a duly authorized agency or department of the City and County or by a court of competent jurisdiction and which nuisance has not been abated. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98; amended by Proposition N, 11/5/2002))\n\nSEC. 20.206.4.  ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT METHODS; DIRECT PAYMENTS TO ROOM AND BOARD FACILITIES PERMITTED.\n     In addition to the emergency assistance provisions of this Article, payment for room, food expense, or both, up to the maximum SSIP payment amount, may at the recipient's option, be paid directly to any board and/or care facility should the recipient or applicant choose to reside, take her/his meals or have full room and board privileges at such facilities. The Executive Director may initiate such a program or payment arrangement, on either a pilot or continuing basis, by putting into effect the appropriate regulations. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.206.5.  SPECIAL ALLOWANCES; TRANSPORTATION OUT OF THE CITY.\n     (a)     The Department of Human Services may provide transportation and maintenance en route to a place out of the City and County where the applicant/recipient will be cared for or her/his interests best served, provided the applicant/recipient, but for fully meeting the residency requirement, is otherwise eligible and voluntarily enters into a signed contractual agreement regarding such transportation with the City and County of San Francisco. Said agreement shall contain a repayment provision permitting recoupment of the amount expended in providing such transportation at a rate not to exceed 10 percent of each payment amount should the person provided transportation thereafter reapply and become eligible for SSIP. \n     (b)     Transportation under this Section shall be provided by the least expensive means available.\n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.207.  CONTINUING ELIGIBILITY.\n     (a)     Persons who meet the requirements for eligibility for SSIP shall receive cash payments pursuant to this Article. Recipients are required to comply with all applicable provisions of this Article and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Recipients who fail to comply with applicable provisions of this Article and the regulations promulgated thereunder may have their SSIP payment withheld and/or decreased and/or discontinued as set forth in Department regulations. \n     (b)     No withholding, decrease, or discontinuance of SSIP payments shall occur unless the person to be affected has been advised of the possibility of such action by means of a Notice of Proposed Action and has been afforded the opportunity for a hearing to dispute the proposed action. \n     (c)     The Department may require applicants/recipients to attend substance abuse or other medical treatment programs as part of their continuing eligibility requirements. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.208.  GOOD CAUSE.\n     For purposes of this Article, where an applicant/recipient is required to show \"good cause\" for not meeting one of his/her obligations or duties under this Article, good cause may be shown by evidence of any of the following: (1) verified hospitalization; (2) verified illness; (3) verified incarceration; (4) verified disability; or other good cause satisfactorily demonstrated to the Executive Director. \n(Added by Ord. 151-98, App. 5/8/98)\n\nSEC. 20.209.  TIMING OF SSIP PAYMENTS.\n     (a)     Emergency Assistance.

Discontinuance of assistance due to the death of the recipient, or at the request of the applicant/recipient is subject to the notice provisions of Section \n20.215(a); however, such discontinuances do not require 10 calendar day prior notice as specified in Section \n20.215(b).

\n          (31)     in consultation with the San Francisco Department of Public Health, provide annual all-staff mandatory trainings, appropriate for each shelter position, that address Cal-OSHA regulatory requirements listed in subsection (30), above, as well as the following topics: \n               (i)     hand washing requirements and other communicable disease prevention;\n               (ii)     proper food handling and storage;\n               (iii)     emergency procedures in case of disaster, fire, or other urgent health or safety risk, including but not limited to CPR requirements;\n               (iv)     safe and appropriate intervention with violent or aggressive shelter clients, including training on the harm reduction model in dealing with substance abuse;

\n          (3)     that the contractor's commitment to comply with contractual obligations that this Article imposes is a material element of the City's consideration for this contract; that the failure of the contractor to comply with such obligations will cause harm to the City and the public that is significant and substantial but extremely difficult to quantify; and that the assessment of liquidated damages of up to $250.00 made pursuant to the liquidated damages schedule referred to in section \n20.406(b)(1) below for every unmitigated failure to comply with such obligations is a reasonable amount of damages to redress the harm to the City caused by such obligations;

The City and the shelter operators contemplated that the shelters would operate at or near capacity through most of the year. This legislation may reduce the number of beds available in some shelters. In addition this legislation will impose obligations on shelter operators that exceed their obligations under their existing agreements with the City and therefore increase their operating costs. City officials and shelter operators based their budgetary assumptions and contracting decisions on factors that existed before this legislation existed. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors authorizes each City department overseeing contracts affected by this legislation to negotiate amendments to existing contracts to reflect these changes so long as current contract amounts are not reduced; and 32. maximize the space for sleeping in the shelter to the fullest extent possible. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3/28/2008; Ord. 131-10, File no. 100437, App. 6/24/2010)\n\nSEC. 20.405.  COMPLAINT PROCESS AND INVESTIGATION.\n     (a)     Each shelter shall provide client complaint forms in common areas of the shelter and shall make a complaint form available to a shelter client upon request. In addition, shelter staff must accept and investigate written client complaints from the Shelter Monitoring Committee. Shelter staff shall review and respond to written client complaints within 2 business days. Shelter staff shall make best efforts to take necessary corrective action in response to all client complaints internally within 5 days. If the client is not satisfied with the response, the shelter operator shall refer the complaint to the contract monitor and to the Shelter Monitoring Committee. The Shelter Monitoring Committee shall investigate these complaints within 10 days of receipt of the complaint and shall provide the shelter operator with an opportunity to respond to the allegations. The Shelter Monitoring Committee shall also forward the results of its investigation to the Director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health (DPH), or his or her designee, who shall comply with Section \n20.406(a) below within 30 days. \n     (b)     Each Director, in consultation with the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, shall promulgate appropriate guidelines or rules for the enforcement of the shelter operator's contractual obligations imposed pursuant to this Article. Such guidelines or rules may establish procedures for ensuring fair, efficient, and cost-effective implementation of these obligations, including mechanisms to monitor contractor compliance and to determine whether a contractor has failed to comply with its contract obligations set forth in Section \n20.404, above. \n     (c)     Committee teams conducting site visits may initiate investigations into alleged violations of contractual obligations imposed by this Chapter and shall forward a request for a full investigation to the full Shelter Monitoring Committee. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3/28/2008; Ord. 131-10, File no. 100437, App. 6/24/2010)\n\nSEC. 20.406.  CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN, IMPOSITION OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.\n     (a)     Where the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, after providing the contractor with the opportunity to respond to the alleged violation, determines that a contractor failed to comply with the provisions of this Article, the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, shall provide written notice to the contractor and the contract monitor as follows: \n          (1)     the factual basis for the determination;\n          (2)     the corrective action plan that the contractor must take to remedy the violation;\n          (3)     the amount of liquidated damages that the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, has assessed for the contractor's violation of this Article; \n          (4)     notice that the contractor has 15 days to either follow the required corrective action plan, including payment of liquidated damages, or to file an appeal consistent with subsection (5), below; \n          (5)     that the contractor has the right to appeal the Director of DPH, or his or her designee's final determination, including the assessment of liquidated damages and the amount assessed, to an arbitration panel appointed by the Director of DPH, but that the contractor must file any such appeal in writing with the arbitration panel within 15 days of the date of the issuance of the City's determination and that a contractor's failure to exhaust this administrative remedy will bar subsequent judicial action challenging the City's determination; \n          (6)     that if the contractor fails to follow the corrective action plan or file an appeal in writing with the arbitration panel within 15 days as set forth above, the Director of DPH, or his or her designee's determination shall be the City's final and binding decision which the City may enforce in a court of law, and \n          (7)     that the contractor must comply with the decision within 5 business days of the City's decision becoming final, including payment of liquidated damages, if any, together with simple annual interest of 10% from the date that payment should have been made. \n     (b)     (1)     liquidated damages in the maximum amount set forth in this section are a reasonable estimate of harm to the City caused by the contractor's non-compliance with contract provisions required by this Article, the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, may determine that less than the full amount is warranted depending on the circumstances of each case. The Director of Public Health, or his or her designee, shall adopt a schedule for liquidated damages based on the degree of harm that the violation causes, the number of days the violation occurs, and the number of shelter clients affected by the violation. In addition, the Director of Public Health, or his or her designee, shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of liquidated damages, if any, to impose against a contractor who fails to comply with contract provisions required by this Article: \n               (A)     the size of the contractor's business;\n               (B)     the contractor's good faith efforts to comply with contract provisions required by this Article;\n               (C)     the gravity of the violation;\n               (D)     whether the contractor has a history of violations of contract provisions required by this Article;\n               (E)     whether the contractor has failed to comply with recordkeeping requirements imposed by contract provisions under this Article; and \n               (F)     whether the imposition of liquidated damages would undermine the purpose of this Article by imposing unreasonable financial burdens on the contractor, thereby imperiling the contractor's ability to continue complying with contract provisions required by this Article. \n     (c)     (1)     15 days of receiving an appeal from the Director of Public Health, or his or her designee's final determination, the arbitration panel shall so inform the Shelter Monitoring Committee, the contract monitor, the shelter operator, the Director of DPH, or his or her designee, and/or their respective counsel or authorized representative. The arbitration panel may assign a hearing officer within the panel to collect and review evidence and to make recommendations to the full arbitration panel, but the full arbitration panel must issue written findings and orders consistent with subsection (4), below. \n          (2)     The arbitration panel shall promptly set a date for a hearing. The hearing must commence within 45 days of the notification of the appeal to the arbitration panel and conclude within 75 days of such notification, not including the issuance of a decision, unless all parties agree to an extended period. If a contractor appeals the Director of DPH, or his or her designee's initial determination but fails to attend a hearing set under this subsection, the Director of DPH, or his or her designee's initial determination shall become final. \n          (3)     The Director of DPH, or his or her designee, shall have the burden of producing evidence demonstrating the contractor's violation of contract provisions required by this Article and warranting imposition of liquidated damages. The contractor shall have the right to present evidence on its behalf in response to any alleged violation of contract provisions required by this Article. \n          (4)     Within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing, the arbitration panel shall issue a written decision affirming, modifying, or vacating the City's determination relating to the violation of the contract obligations that this Article imposes, the corrective action that the contractor must take to remedy any violation, and the amount of liquidated damages to be assessed, if any. The arbitration panel's decision shall consist of findings and a determination, which shall be the City's final decision. \n          (5)     The contractor shall comply with the arbitration panel's decision, including the payment of liquidated damages, within 5 business days of service of the decision. Service shall be made by first class mail to the contractor's address of record. Failure to pay liquidated damages within the time specified in this ordinance shall result in interest on the unpaid damages at the simple annual interest rate of 10% from the day that such damages were due. \n          (6)     The contractor may seek review of the arbitration panel's decision only by filing in the San Francisco Superior Court a petition for a writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5, as may be amended from time to time. \n          (7)     When a contractor fails to take corrective action or pay damages within the time required by the provisions of this section, the City may immediately pursue all available remedies against the contractor for breach of contract, including debarment proceedings where applicable and filing a civil action to recover liquidated damages due under this Article. \n          (8)     The failure of the City to comply with the time requirements of this section shall not cause the City or the arbitration panel to lose jurisdiction over an appeal from the City's determination filed under this section. \n     (d)     Liquidated damages obtained pursuant to contract provisions required by this Article shall be deposited in the City's general fund. \n     (e)     Six months after the effective date of this ordinance, the Director of DPH shall provide a written report to the Board of Supervisors that shall address the following issues; the level of shelter compliance with this Chapter; the number of cases that have resulted in the imposition of liquidated damages; the number of cases that have been referred to an arbitration panel; and the financial impact of this Chapter, if any, on DPH. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3/28/2008)\n\nSEC. 20.407.  SEVERABILITY.\n     If any section, subsection, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or federal or State agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3/28/2008)\n\nSEC. 20.408.  LIMITED TO PROMOTION OF GENERAL WELFARE.\n     In undertaking the adoption and enforcement of this Article, the City and County of San Francisco is assuming an undertaking only to promote the general welfare. It is not assuming, nor is it imposing on its commissions, departments, officers and employees, an obligation for breach of which it is liable in money damages to any person who claims that such breach proximately caused injury. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3/28/2008)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
