{"text":"\n     (a)     This Chapter applies to all contracts and property contracts, except where the FSHA determines that application of the requirements of this Chapter is not feasible or conflicts with applicable Federal or State law. In addition, this Chapter applies to any and all work performed in the City by a City contractor. \n     (b)     As an essential term of, and consideration for, any contract or property contract with the City, not exempted by the FSHA, the Contractor shall enter into a first source hiring agreement (\"agreement\") with the City, on or before the effective date of the contract or property contract. Contractors shall also enter into an agreement with the City for any other work that it performs in the City. Such agreement shall: \n          (1)     Set appropriate hiring and retention goals for entry level positions. The employer shall agree to achieve these hiring and retention goals, or, if unable to achieve these goals, to establish good faith efforts as to its attempts to do so, as set forth in the agreement. The agreement shall take into consideration the employer's participation in existing job training, referral and/or brokerage programs. Within the discretion of the FSHA, subject to appropriate modifications, participation in such programs may be certified as meeting the requirements of this Chapter. Failure either to achieve the specified goal, or to establish good faith efforts will constitute noncompliance and will subject the employer to the provisions of Section \n83.10 of this Chapter. \n          (2)     Set first source interviewing, recruitment and hiring requirements, which will provide the San Francisco Workforce Development System with the first opportunity to provide qualified economically disadvantaged individuals for consideration for employment for entry level positions. Employers shall consider all applications of qualified economically disadvantaged individuals referred by the System for employment; provided however, if the employer utilizes nondiscriminatory screening criteria, the employer shall have the sole discretion to interview and/or hire individuals referred or certified by the San Francisco Workforce Development System as being qualified economically disadvantaged individuals. The duration of the first source interviewing requirement shall be determined by the FSHA and shall be set forth in each agreement, but shall not exceed 10 days. During that period, the employer may publicize the entry level positions in accordance with the agreement. A need for urgent or temporary hires must be evaluated, and appropriate provisions for such a situation must be made in the agreement. \n          (3)     Set appropriate requirements for providing notification of available entry level positions to the San Francisco Workforce Development System so that the System may train and refer an adequate pool of qualified economically disadvantaged individuals to participating employers. Notification should include such information as employment needs by occupational title, skills, and/or experience required, the hours required, wage scale and duration of employment, identification of entry level and training positions, identification of English language proficiency requirements, or absence thereof, and the projected schedule and procedures for hiring for each occupation. Employers should provide both long-term job need projections and notice before initiating the interviewing and hiring process. These notification requirements will take into consideration any need to protect the employer's proprietary information. \n          (4)     Set appropriate record keeping and monitoring requirements. The First Source Hiring Administration shall develop easy-to-use forms and record keeping requirements for documenting compliance with the agreement. To the greatest extent possible, these requirements shall utilize the employer's existing record keeping systems, be nonduplicative, and facilitate a coordinated flow of information and referrals. \n          (5)     Establish guidelines for employer good faith efforts to comply with the first source hiring requirements of this Chapter. The FSHA will work with City departments to develop employer good faith effort requirements appropriate to the types of contracts and property contracts handled by each department. Employers shall appoint a liaison for dealing with the development and implementation of the employer's agreement. In the event that the FSHA finds that the employer under a City contract or property contract has taken actions primarily for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of this Chapter, that employer shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in Section \n83.10 of this Chapter. \n          (6)     Set the term of the requirements.\n          (7)     Set appropriate enforcement and sanctioning standards consistent with this Chapter.\n          (8)     Set forth the City's obligations to develop training programs, job applicant referrals, technical assistance, and information systems that assist the employer in complying with this Chapter. \n          (9)     Require the developer to include notice of the requirements of this Chapter in leases, subleases, and other occupancy contracts.\n     (c)     The employer shall make the final determination of whether an economically disadvantaged individual referred by the System is \"qualified\" for the position. Any qualified economically disadvantaged individual who is hired by the employer shall have the same rights and obligations as all other employees in similar positions. The employer shall not discriminate against any employees on the basis of participation in the First Source Hiring Program. Any such discrimination shall be considered a breach of the employer's \"good faith\" obligations under the agreement, and shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in Section \n83.10 of this Chapter. \n     (d)     Compliance by an employer with a City department's approved plan shall be deemed to be compliance with the requirements of this Chapter. \n     (e)     In any situation where the FSHA concludes based upon application by the employer that compliance with this Chapter would cause economic hardship the FSHA may grant an exception to any or all of the requirements of this Chapter. \n(Added by Ord. 264-98, App. 8/21/98; amended by Ord. 250-04, File No. 041190, App. 10/14/2004; Ord. 76-06, File No. 060166, App. 4/20/2006) \n\n","heading":{"title":"83","chaptersection":"9","identifier":"83.9","catch_text":"FIRST SOURCE HIRING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTS AND PROPERTY CONTRACTS, AND OTHER WORK PERFORMED IN THE CITY BY CITY CONTRACTORS."}}
