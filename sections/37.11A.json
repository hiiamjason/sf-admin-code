In any case, calculation of rent overpayments and re-setting of the lawful base rent shall be based on a determination of the validity of all rent increases imposed since April 1, 1982, in accordance with Sections \n37.3(b)(5) and \n37.3(a)(2) above. The prevailing party in any civil action brought under this Section \n37.11A shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. The remedy available under this Section shall be in addition to any other existing remedies which may be available to the tenant. \n(Added by Ord. 20-84, App. 1/19/84; amended by Ord. 162-93, App. 5/28/93; Ord. 363-93, App. 11/18/93; Ord. 293-98, App. 10/2/98)\n\n","heading":{"title":"37","chaptersection":"11A. ","identifier":"37.11A. ","catch_text":"CIVIL ACTIONS."}}
