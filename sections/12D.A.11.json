The Board further finds that race-neutral measures employed by the City have not prevented such discriminatory practices from occurring. \n     (B)     Contract awarding authorities shall apply all bid discounts as enumerated in Section \n12D.A.9(A) to all commodities contracts the estimated cost of which exceeds $2,500 and general services contracts the estimated cost of which exceeds $10,000. \n     (C)     In addition to the duties given the Office of Contract Administration elsewhere in this Section, the Office of Contract Administration shall maintain, with the assistance of the Director, a current list of MBEs and WBEs to provide each of those commodities or services subject to this ordinance that the Office of Contract Administration indicates are required by the City. \n     (D)     The Office of Contract Administration shall also maintain a central office where all bids, requests for proposals and solicitations will be listed and kept current. \n(Added by Ord. 296-98, App. 10/5/98; amended by Ord. 134-03, File No. 030347, App. 6/1/2003)\n\n","heading":{"title":"12D","chaptersection":"A.11","identifier":"12D.A.11","catch_text":"PURCHASING CONTRACTS."}}
