{"text":"\n     The Minimum Wage established pursuant to Section 4(b)\n1 of this Chapter shall apply to the City's Welfare-to-Work Programs under which persons must perform work in exchange for receipt of benefits. Participants in Welfare-to-Work Programs shall not, during a given benefits period, be required to work more than a number of hours equal to the value of all cash benefits received during that period, divided by the Minimum Wage. Where state or federal law would preclude the City from reducing the number of work hours required under a given Welfare-to-Work Program, the City may comply with this Section by increasing the cash benefits awarded so that their value is no less than the product of the Minimum Wage multiplied by the number of work hours required. \n(Added by Proposition L, 11/4/2003)\nCODIFICATION NOTE\n\n1.     Reference should be to Sec. \n12R.4(b).\n\n","heading":{"title":"12R","chaptersection":"10. ","identifier":"12R.10. ","catch_text":"APPLICATION OF MINIMUM WAGE TO WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAMS."}}
