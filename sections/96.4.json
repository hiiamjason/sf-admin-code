{"text":"\n     Whenever the Chief of Police proposes to act on a complaint sustained by the OCC and the proposed action is not consistent with the OCC's recommendation to refer the matter to the Police Commission for discipline because the Chief of Police is proposing either a suspension of ten days or less, or no discipline, the Chief of Police shall, prior to taking action, notify the OCC in writing of the proposed action, and shall meet and confer with the OCC Director within five business days of the written notice to resolve the disagreement over the appropriate discipline. Where the OCC and the Chief of Police are unable to reach agreement on the appropriate discipline, the OCC and the Chief of Police shall send written notice to the Police Commission identifying the sustained complaint and describing the disagreement. This notice shall be a part of the Director's Report at the next Commission meeting, consistent with applicable laws governing public notice of meetings. \n(Added by Ord. 244-03, File No. 031401, App. 10/17/2003)\n\n","heading":{"title":"96","chaptersection":"4. ","identifier":"96.4. ","catch_text":"NOTICE TO OCC OF PROPOSED ACTION."}}
