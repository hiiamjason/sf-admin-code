{"text":"\n     A tenant who loses the use of one or more rooms during the course of the seismic strengthening program is entitled to reimbursement by the owner for lost use. For purposes of this chapter, \"lost use\" shall be defined as any loss of use of a room undergoing seismic work for the period stated in the contractor's notice as provided in Section \n65.2 above. The permanent loss of one percent or less of the habitable square footage of the entire dwelling unit shall be deemed de minimis and therefore shall not constitute \"lost use.\" If the permanent loss of habitable square footage of the entire dwelling unit exceeds one percent, then the Rent Board will determine whether or not the loss is de minimis. \n(Added by Ord. 220-92, App. 7/14/92)\n\n","heading":{"title":"65","chaptersection":"3","identifier":"65.3","catch_text":"RENT REDUCTIONS."}}
