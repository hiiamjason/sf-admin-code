{"text":"\n     (a)     When the Partnership Ends. A Domestic Partnership ends when: \n          (1)     One partner sends the other a written notice that he or she has ended the partnership; or\n          (2)     One of the partners dies; or\n          (3)     One of the partners marries or the partners no longer live together.\n     (b)     Notice the Partnership Has Ended.\n          (1)     To Domestic Partners. When a Domestic Partnership ends, at least one of the partners must sign a notice saying that the partnership has ended. The notice must be dated and signed under penalty of perjury. If the Declaration of Domestic Partnership was filed with the County Clerk, the notice must be filed with the clerk; otherwise, the notice must be notarized. The partner who signs the notice must send a copy to the other partner. \n          (2)     To Third Parties. When a Domestic Partnership ends, a Domestic Partner who has given a copy of a Declaration of Domestic Partnership to any third party, (or, if that partner has died, the surviving member of the domestic partnership) must give that third party a notice signed under penalty of perjury stating the partnership has ended. The notice must be sent within 60 days of the end of the domestic partnership. \n          (3)     Failure to Give Notice. Failure to give either of the notices required by this subsection will neither prevent nor delay termination of the Domestic Partnership. Anyone who suffers any loss as a result of failure to send either of these notices may sue for actual losses. \n(Added by Proposition K, 11/6/90)\n\n","heading":{"title":"62","chaptersection":"4","identifier":"62.4","catch_text":"ENDING DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS."}}
