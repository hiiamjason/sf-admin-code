In calculating the credit to be granted for service rendered on a part-time basis, for purposes of determining qualifications for retirement, the service required in the next preceding paragraph for credit for a year of service shall not be used, but instead, a year of service shall be credited for each year during which the member was employed throughout the year on a part-time basis and was engaged in his duties the full amount of time he was required by his employment to be so engaged. Credit for fractional years shall be granted to the extent of the fraction derived by dividing the time during which the member was engaged in his duties within the years, by the time he was required by his employment to be so engaged. \n(Amended by Ord. 299-64, App. 11/9/64)\n\n","heading":{"title":"16","chaptersection":"37-7","identifier":"16.37-7","catch_text":"CALCULATION OF SERVICE CREDIT BASED ON PART-TIME SERVICES."}}
