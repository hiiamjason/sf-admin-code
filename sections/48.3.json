HSA shall adopt rules and regulations to implement the Rental Subsidy Program consistent with this ordinance. HSA shall ensure that contractors administering this program communicate with families eligible for the Rental Subsidy Program in the families' primary languages. In addition.

Families receiving a rental subsidy through the original program as administered by HSA prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall be deemed to have applied for the Rental Subsidy Program and to have received a subsidy under the Rental Subsidy Program as of the date that they received their first rental subsidy from the City. \n(Added by Ord. 229-09, File No. 090931, App. 11/10/2009)\n\n","heading":{"title":"48","chaptersection":"3","identifier":"48.3","catch_text":"ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAM."}}
