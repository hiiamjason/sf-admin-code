This decision may require a determination as to whether the petitioner is permanent resident. \n     (b)     Upon an Administrative Law Judge's findings of fact and decision that the operator of a residential hotel has violated the requirement to install a United States Postal Service-approved mail receptacle for receipt of mail delivered by the United States Postal Service, the Administrative Law Judge may conclude that the resident has suffered a diminution in housing services and order a corresponding reduction in rent. \n     (c)     The decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall be final unless the Board vacates the decision on appeal.\n     (d)     Either party may file an appeal of the Administrative Law Judge's decision with the Board. Such appeals are governed by Section \n37.8(f). \n(Added by Ord. 73-06, File No. 060188, App. 4/20/2006)\n\n","heading":{"title":"37","chaptersection":"14B","identifier":"37.14B","catch_text":"   HEARING, RESIDENTIAL HOTEL MAIL RECEPTACLES."}}
