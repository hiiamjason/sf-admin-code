{"text":"\n     (a)     The CDO shall establish for adoption by COIT rules and standards to implement the open data policy, including developing standards to determine which data sets are appropriate for public disclosure. In making this determination, COIT shall balance the benefits of open data set forth in Section \n22D.1, above, with the need to protect from disclosure information that is proprietary, confidential, or protected by law or contract. \n     (b)     The CDO shall promulgate and COIT shall adopt rules and standards to implement the open data policy which shall apply to all Departments, consistent with COIT's role and responsibilities in San Francisco Administrative Code Section \n22A.3. The CDO and COIT intend to work with the City Attorney's Office and purchaser to develop contract provisions to promote open data policies. The rules and standards shall include the following: \n          (1)     Technical requirements for the publishing of public data sets by Departments for the purpose of making public data available to the greatest number of users and for the greatest number of applications. These rules shall, whenever practicable, use non-proprietary technical standards for web publishing and e-government; \n          (2)     Guidelines for Departments to follow in developing their plans for implementing the open data policy consistent with the standards established by COIT. Each plan shall include an accounting of public data sets under the control of the Department;  \n          (3)     Rules for including open data requirements in applicable City contracts and standard contract provisions that promote the City's open data policies, including, where appropriate, provisions to ensure that the City retains ownership of City data and the ability to post the data on data.sfgov.org or make it available through other means; and,\n          (4)     Requirements that a third party providing City data (or applications based on City data) to the public explicitly identify the source and version of the public data set, and include a description of any modifications made to the public data set.\n(Added by Ord. 293-10, File No. 101155, App. 11/18/2010; amended by Ord. 69-13, File No. 121017, App. 4/23/2013, Eff. 5/23/2013)\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis Code of Ordinances and/or any other documents that appear on this site may not reflect the most current legislation adopted by the Municipality.
