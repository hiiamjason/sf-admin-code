{"text":"\n     The Board makes the following findings. \n     A.     The cost of healthcare continues to increase, making it harder for people to obtain the proper care they need.\n     B.     The City and County of San Francisco's financial resources are strained and healthcare services the City now provides are either being cut or are at risk of being cut. \n     C.     Section \n4.110 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco provides that the Health Department and Health Commission shall provide for the preservation, promotion and protection of the physical and mental health of the inhabitants of the City and County of San Francisco. \n     D.     Section 127340(a) of the California Health and Safety Code provides that \"private not-for-profit hospitals meet certain needs of their communities through the provision of essential healthcare and other services. Public recognition of their unique status has led to favorable tax treatment by the government. In exchange, nonprofit hospitals assume a social obligation to provide community benefits in the public interest.\" \n     E.     Due to their size, larger non-government healthcare providers have significant impact on the health of the people of the City and County of San Francisco. Therefore such providers have a responsibility to work along with government healthcare agencies and facilities to maintain the health of the communities they serve. \n(Added by Ord. 224-04, File No. 041072, App. 8/25/2004)\n\n","heading":{"title":"97","chaptersection":"1","identifier":"97.1","catch_text":"FINDINGS AND PURPOSE."}}
