Service in an irregular schedule does not constitute continuous service for vacation purposes. \n     (d)     \"Maximum vacation entitlement\" means the maximum vacation allowance an employee may earn in any 12 month period. The amount is based on years of continuous service as follows: \n\nYears of\nContinuous Service\nMaximum Vacation\nEntitlement\n1 through 5 years\n80 hours\nmore than 5 through 15 years\n120 hours\nmore than 15 years\n160 hours\n     (e)     \"Paid service\" means service in paid status with the City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Unified School District or the Community College District, as applicable, and includes hours paid as sick leave, vacation, compensatory time-off and overtime for employees who are eligible for overtime pay under the administrative provisions of the Annual Salary Standardization Ordinance. \n     (f)     \"Regular work schedule\" means a work schedule consisting of a pre-determined and fixed number of hours to be worked on a routine basis and includes an authorized flex-time schedule. \n     (g)     \"Temporary disability\" means temporary disability pursuant to the Worker's Compensation or State Disability Laws of the State of California or the industrial disability provisions of Charter Sections \n8.515 or \n8.516. \n     (h)     \"Vacation allowance\" means the leave with pay for vacation purposes which an employee accrues or is awarded under the terms of this ordinance. \n     (i)     \"Vacation with pay\" means the compensation the employee would have earned during the vacation period if the employee had worked during the same period, without the inclusion of overtime earnings or special pay. \n     (j)     \"Unpaid furlough\" means voluntary or involuntary time off without pay imposed or approved in accordance with a Civil Service Rule governing unpaid furloughs in response to a projected budgetary shortfall. \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85; amended by Ord. 54-93, App. 3/4/93)\n\nSEC. 16.11.  CALCULATION OF VACATIONS.\n     (a)     No employee is entitled to a vacation allowance until the employee has completed one year of continuous service.\n     (b)     For purposes of determining the vacation allowance the anniversary date for an employee shall be the first date of employment in the current period of continuous service. \n     (c)     Continuous service shall not be deemed to have been breached:\n          (1)     By an employee because of absence from service due to duly authorized leave; or\n          (2)     By a permanent employee laid off due to lack of work or funds, provided the employee is reappointed to a position in the service with a regular work schedule within five years of lay-off; or \n          (3)     By a permanent school term employee because of a period when schools are not normally in session; or\n          (4)     By a permanent employee who resigns in good standing and is reappointed to a position in the service with a regular work schedule within six months from the effective date of resignation; or \n          (5)     By a temporary or provisional (noncivil service or limited tenure) employee who has completed one year of continuous service and resigns in good standing or is laid off and is reappointed to a position in the service with a regular work schedule within six months from the effective date of resignation or layoff; or \n          (6)     By an employee who has resigned from a position with services certified as other than satisfactory by the appointing officer if the employee is granted reappointment rights by the Civil Service Commission and is reappointed to a position in the service with a regular work schedule within six months from the effective date of resignation; \n          (7)     By a period of voluntary or involuntary furlough without pay imposed or approved in accordance with a Civil Service Rule governing unpaid furloughs in response to a projected budgetary shortfall. \n     (d)     Without regard to any other provisions in this Section, no vacation allowance is earned for paid service in an irregular work schedule. \n     (e)     An employee who has completed one year of continuous service shall accrue vacation allowance at the rate of .0385 of an hour for each hour of qualifying service. An employee who has completed five years of continuous service shall accrue thereafter a vacation allowance at a rate of .0577 of an hour for each hour of paid service. An employee who has completed 15 years of continuous service shall accrue a vacation allowance a rate of .077 of an hour for each hour of paid service. \n     (f)     No employee shall be credited with more than 2080 hours of paid service in any 12 month period for purposes of computing the vacation allowance. \n     (g)     The vacation allowance for an employee receiving temporary disability benefits shall be computed on the basis of the number of hours in the employee's regular work schedule; provided, however, that an employee not supplementing State Disability Insurance payments with earnings from paid service will not accrue a vacation allowance during the period of disability. An employee who has received a permanent disability award and who does not return to employment because of such disability is not entitled to accrue a vacation allowance. \n     (h)     For members of the uniformed force of the Fire Department, the factors for earning vacation allowance, the maximum number of hours credited for vacation allowance purposes and the maximum number of vacation hours an employee may accrue shall be administered in a manner consistent with the intent of this ordinance and approved by the General Manager, Personnel. In addition, if necessary because of minimum daily staffing requirements and the financial and scheduling problems created in bringing the uniformed force into conformity with Section \n16.12(e) and (f), the Fire Department may establish an alternative schedule or other means for decreasing in an equitable manner the maximum accrual of vacation allowance to an amount consistent with that permitted other City employees under Section \n16.12(e) no later than December 31, 1989. If the Fire Department establishes an alternative schedule, it may not permit a member of the uniformed force to accrue vacation days or hours in excess of the following: \n\nYears of Continuous Service\nMaximum Accrual\n1 through 5 years\n50 days\nor 400 hours\nmore than 5 years through 15 years\n60 days\nor 480 hours\nmore than 15 years\n70 days\nor 560 hours\n     (i)     Any dispute over whether an employee is assigned to a regular or an irregular work schedule shall be finally decided by the Civil Service Commission. \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85; Ord. 54-93, App. 3/4/93)\n\nSEC. 16.12.  AWARD AND ACCRUAL OF VACATION.\n     (a)     Beginning with the first full pay period after the effective date of this ordinance, an employee shall be awarded the employee's vacation allowance on the first day of the pay period following the pay period in which the allowance is accrued. \n     (b)     An employee does not accrue vacation allowance in the first year of continuous service, however, at the end of one year of continuous service, an employee shall be awarded a vacation allowance computed at the rate of .0385 of an hour for each hour of paid service in the preceding year. \n     (c)     At the end of five years of continuous service, an employee shall be awarded a one-time vacation allowance computed at the rate of .01924 of an hour for each hour of paid service in the preceding year except that the amount of the vacation allowance shall not exceed 40 hours. \n     (d)     At the end of fifteen years of continuous service, an employee shall be awarded a one-time vacation allowance computed at the rate of .01924 of an hour for each hour of paid service in the preceding year except that the amount of the vacation allowance shall not exceed 40 hours. \n     (e)     The maximum number of vacation hours an employee may accrue consists of 240 hours carried forward from prior years plus the employee's maximum vacation entitlement which is based on the number of years of service. The maximum number of vacation hours which an employee may accrue is as follows: \n\nYears of Continuous Service\nMaximum Accrual\n1 through 5 years\n320 hours\nmore than 5 through 15 years\n360 hours\nmore than 15 years\n400 hours\n     (f)     On the first day of the second pay period following the effective date of this ordinance, employees shall be awarded any vacation allowance accrued between January 1, 1985, and the first day of the second pay period following the effective date of this ordinance. In order to prevent employees from unfairly losing accrued vacation allowance in the transition from an award date of January 1st of each year, the limitation on the number of vacation hours an employee may accrue as set forth in Subsection \n16.12(e) shall not apply between the effective date of this ordinance and January 9, 1987. Vacation allowance hours in excess of those set forth in Section \n16.12(e) will be lost if not used before January 9, 1987. \n(Amended by Ord. 97-86, App. 3/27/86)\n\nSEC. 16.13.  EFFECT OF SEPARATION UPON VACATION.\n     An employee in the final year of service may with the approval of the appointing officer elect to receive a cash payment in lieu of vacation due at the time of separation, provided that the appointment and payment of a replacement for the period of time representing such cash payment in lieu of vacation is not required. In lieu of such cash payment an employee who separates from City and County service and who without interruption in service is appointed to any governmental agency whose employees are eligible for membership in the San Francisco City and County Retirement System may elect to transfer such accumulated vacation to such agency if the agency rule or regulation permits the crediting of such accumulated vacation. \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85)\n\nSEC. 16.14.  VACATION SCHEDULES.\n     (a)     Appointing officers are responsible for approving vacation schedules. In approving vacation schedules, the appointing officers shall give due regard to employee seniority and preference and the needs of the service. Unless an emergency situation exists requiring the immediate presence of an employee, an employee shall be allowed to begin a vacation on the day immediately following the employee's normal day off. \n     (b)     With the approval of the appointing officer, an employee's vacation allowance may be taken in increments of not less than one hour. \n     (c)     Except as requested by the employee to supplement disability benefits, the vacation allowance of an employee, who has started a vacation and who suffers a nonindustrial injury or illness or a recurrence of an industrial injury or illness during such vacation and who is entitled to and receives temporary disability benefits, shall not be charged for periods in which the employee receives disability benefits. \n     (d)     Every department shall maintain records which shall include, in addition to all other information required by the Civil Service Commission and Controller, the employee's accrued vacation allowance. When an employee accepts a permanent appointment to another department, the employee's vacation and sick leave records shall be transferred by the first department to the second department. Ninety calendar days after an automated payroll/personnel data system is fully implemented in a department, and, upon approval of the General Manager, Personnel, and the Controller, the maintenance of such records by the department shall no longer be required. All records shall, however, continue to be preserved according to present statutory requirements. \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85)\n\nSEC. 16.15.  USE OF PARTIAL VACATION TO SUPPLEMENT DISABILITY LEAVE.\n     An employee who is absent from duty because of temporary disability may use his or her vacation allowance to supplement disability benefits; provided, that when the vacation allowance payment is added to the disability benefits payable under the Workers' Compensation or State Disability Insurance Laws, the employee's bi-weekly payment will not exceed the normal salary of the employee for the regular work schedule effective at the commencement of the disability. An employee desiring to use his or her vacation allowance to supplement State Disability Insurance benefits shall, within seven calendar days following the first day of absence, and on a form provided by the Civil Service Commission, so inform his or her appointing officer or designated representative. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee receiving temporary workers' compensation disability benefits may accrue vacation hours in excess of the maximum accrual permitted pursuant to Section 16.12(e). Upon the cessation of the employee's receipt of temporary disability benefits the employee shall receive a cash payment for any vacation hours accrued in excess of the number the employee was permitted to accrue pursuant to Section \n16.12(e). \n(Amended by Ord. 182-85, App. 4/12/85)\n\nSEC. 16.16.  VACATION CHARGES BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS.\n     The Controller shall establish procedures for the method of payment of salaries to employees entitled to vacation from service in two or more departments of the City and County. \n(Added by Ord. 316-81, App. 6/19/81)\n\nSEC. 16.17.  PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.\n     (a)     Appointing Officers, as defined in Administrative Code Section \n2A.30, in the City and County of San Francisco are authorized, but not required, to place any City employee in their department on paid administrative leave under the following circumstances:\n          (1)     When the City has initiated an investigation relating to an employee's conduct, and the Appointing Officer determines that the employee should be placed on leave during some or all of the investigation in order to protect the legitimate interests of the City, including but not limited to, potential interference with the effectiveness of the investigation, or potential harm to employees, to the public interest or to the operation of the City, for a period of time beginning not earlier than the start of the investigation and ending not later than the date the investigation is completed, subject to a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days;\n          (2)     When the City requires an employee to submit to drug and/or alcohol testing pursuant to the terms of a City or departmental policy, a Memorandum of Understanding between the City and a recognized employee organization, or local, state or federal law, for the period of time between the date the City directs the employee to submit to such testing until the employee refuses such testing or the testing is completed and the City is advised of the results of the testing, subject to a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days;\n          (3)     When the City medically removes an employee pursuant to standards set forth by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations;\n          (4)     When the City requires an employee to undergo a fitness for duty examination pursuant to Civil Service Rules 116, 216, 316, 416, or any similar successor rules, for up to the period of time from the date the City directs the employee to undergo a fitness for duty examination until: (i) the date the examination is completed and the City is notified by the examining physician whether the employee is fit for duty; or (ii) the date the employee refuses examination. Paid administrative leave under this subsection is subject to a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days. In the event that the examining physician does not notify the City that the employee is fit for duty on the day of the examination, the Appointing Officer shall place the employee on compulsory sick leave pursuant to the Civil Service Rules starting on the business day following the examination. Should the examining physician thereafter declare the employee fit for duty, the City shall restore any sick leave deducted between the date of the examination and the date the City is so notified or, in the event the employee has no accrued sick leave, any lost compensation for the same period.\n     (b)     While an employee is on paid administrative leave the employee shall receive the compensation he or she would have earned if the employee had worked during the same period, without the inclusion of overtime earnings or special pay.\n     (c)     The Appointing Officer shall have the discretion to remove an employee from paid administrative leave at any time during the period of paid administrative leave.\n     (d)     Subject to the prior written approval of the Director of the Department of Human Resources, the Appointing Officer may extend paid administrative leave one (l) time consistent with this Section for no more than an additional thirty (30) calendar days. For Service Critical Employees employed by the Municipal Transportation Agency, the Director of the Municipal Transportation Agency may extend paid administrative leave one (1) time consistent with this Section for no more than an additional thirty (30) calendar days. Under no circumstances may an employee be on paid administrative leave for more than sixty (60) calendar days relating to the same incident.\n     (e)     The City's ability to place employees on paid administrative leave under this section is in addition to, not in lieu of, its right to place employees on unpaid administrative leave under Charter Section \nA8.341, or any similar successor Charter Section. The City may elect to place an employee on paid or unpaid administrative leave as permitted under this Section or under Charter Section \nA8.341. Further, the City may place an employee on paid administrative leave either before or after the employee is placed on unpaid administrative leave.\n     (f)     Nothing herein shall limit or prohibit compliance with the regulations of the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration in Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations.\n(Added by Ord. 174-11, File No. 110622, App. 9/12/2011, Eff. 10/12/2011)\nARTICLE III:\n[RESERVED]\n\nARTICLE IV:\nRETIREMENT\n\n\nSec. 16.29.\nDefinitions.\n\nSec. 16.29-1.\nDefinitions – Actuarial Equivalent. \n\nSec. 16.29-2.\nDefinitions – Annuity. \n\nSec. 16.29-3.\nDefinitions – Beneficiary. \n\nSec. 16.29-4.\nDefinitions – Board. \n\nSec. 16.29-5.\nDefinitions – City. \n\nSec. 16.29-6.\nDefinitions – City and County Service. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.\nDefinitions – Types of Compensation. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.1.\nDefinitions – Compensation as Distinguished from Benefits. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.2.\nDefinitions – Compensation Earnable by a Member. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.3.\nDefinitions – Final Compensation. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.4.\nDefinitions – Compensation Paid in Lieu of Vacation Excluded. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.5.\nAdoption of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) Limitations. \n\nSec. 16.29-7.6.\nDefinitions – Compensation Paid to Offset Federal Taxation of Health Insurance Premiums Excluded.\n\nSec. 16.29-8.\nDefinitions – Continuous Service. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.\nDefinitions – Types of Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.1.\nDefinitions – Accumulated Additional Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.2.\nDefinitions – Accumulated Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.3.\nDefinitions – Accumulated Normal Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.4.\nDefinitions – Additional Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.5.\nDefinitions – Normal Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.6.\nDefinitions – Prior Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.7.\nDefinitions – Accumulated Prior Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.29-9.8.\nDefinitions – Retroactive Contributions.\n\nSec. 16.29-9.9.\nDefinitions – Accumulated Retroactive Contributions.\n\nSec. 16.29-10.\nDefinitions – Death Allowance.\n\nSec. 16.29-11.\nDefinitions – Employee.\n\nSec. 16.29-12.\nDefinitions – Member. \n\nSec. 16.29-13.\nDefinitions – Member or Police Department or Member of Fire Department. \n\nSec. 16.29-14.\nDefinitions – Pension.\n\nSec. 16.29-15.1.\nDefinitions – Teachers.\n\nSec. 16.29-15.2.\nDefinitions – Members of Police or Fire Departments.\n\nSec. 16.29-15.10.\nDefinitions – Employees of the Health Service System Prior to December 1, 1940.\n\nSec. 16.29-15.11.\nDefinitions – Excluded Because of Employment in Temporary Position.\n\nSec. 16.29-15.12.\nDefinitions – Prior Service in a Part-Time Position. \n\nSec. 16.29-16.\nDefinitions – Regular Interest.\n\nSec. 16.29-17.\nDefinitions – Retirement Allowance.\n\nSec. 16.29-20.\nDefinitions – School Department.\n\nSec. 16.29-21.\nDefinitions – Teacher.\n\nSec. 16.29-22.\nDefinitions – Charter.\n\nSec. 16.29-23.\nDefinitions – Gender and Number. \n\nSec. 16.30-1.\nMeaning of \"Average Final Compensation.\" \n\nSec. 16.32.\nBenefits Not Subject to Garnishment, Etc., and Are Nonassignable. \n\nSec. 16.33.\nCompensation for Witnesses Appearing Before Board. \n\nSec. 16.34.\nTime to Apply for Benefits After Death of Member. \n\nSec. 16.37-1.\nInterest Rates. \n\nSec. 16.37-2.\nActuarial Valuation. \n\nSec. 16.37-3.\nRecords as to Accumulated Contributions. \n\nSec. 16.37-4.\nDetermination of Service Credit.\n\nSec. 16.37-4.1.\nDetermination of Service Credit  for Certain Employees of the San Francisco Unified School District.\n\nSec. 16.37-5.\nPrior Service Credit.\n\nSec. 16.37-6.\nCalculation of Service Credit.\n\nSec. 16.37-7.\nCalculation of Service Credit Based on Part-time Services.\n\nSec. 16.37-8.\nExcess Retirement Benefits.\n\nSec. 16.37-9.\nPower to Issue Subpoenas.\n\nSec. 16.38.\nEstimates by Board of Length of Service, Etc.\n\nSec. 16.41.\nController's Annual Audit.\n\nSec. 16.42.\nPersons Included in the System.\n\nSec. 16.43-1.\nPrior Service Credit;

However, prior service so credited shall be the basis for a retirement allowance or benefit as provided herein only if membership continues unbroken until retirement on a retirement allowance or until the granting of such other benefit; provided, that a termination of membership by the withdrawal of accumulated contributions followed by the redeposit of such contributions upon re-entrance into City and County service shall not constitute a break in membership. \n(Amended by Ord. 79-65, App. 4/7/65; amended by Ord. 326-00, File No. 001921, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 16.37-6.  CALCULATION OF SERVICE CREDIT.\n     The method, heretofore used under the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System in calculating the amount of City and County service to be credited to members, in fixing disability and service retirement allowances and other benefits, in determining effective dates of membership in the Retirement System and in calculating members' contributions to the Retirement System, based upon the assumption that teachers, subsequent to first entering into their duties, are in City and County service throughout that part of the interims between school terms, during which they have been or shall be paid salary installments, is hereby approved solely for the purposes hereof and regardless of the status of such teachers under the state law. No adjustments affecting teachers under the Retirement System shall be made on the basis of payment of teachers' salaries in other than 12 monthly installments; provided, however, that this paragraph shall not prevent adjustments prior to termination of membership in the Retirement System, in contributions because of underpayments or overpayments of salary, nor shall it prevent the Retirement Board from modifying the method referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph, in the event that teachers' salaries shall be paid in other than 12 monthly installments, but such modification shall apply only to City and County service rendered thereafter. \n(Amended by Ord. 299-64, App. 11/9/64)\n\nSEC. 16.37-7.  CALCULATION OF SERVICE CREDIT BASED ON PART-TIME SERVICES.\n     In determining the credit to be granted for services rendered on a part-time basis, for the purposes of calculating retirement allowances, the service shall be reduced to a full-time basis according to the service required in the next preceding paragraph for credit for one year of service, in calculating benefits based on service so determined, compensation earnable shall be taken as the compensation which would be earnable if the employment had been on a full-time basis; and with a compensation derived by multiplying the member's compensation by the ratio of full time to the time he was required by his employment to engage in his duties. In calculating the credit to be granted for service rendered on a part-time basis, for purposes of determining qualifications for retirement, the service required in the next preceding paragraph for credit for a year of service shall not be used, but instead, a year of service shall be credited for each year during which the member was employed throughout the year on a part-time basis and was engaged in his duties the full amount of time he was required by his employment to be so engaged. Credit for fractional years shall be granted to the extent of the fraction derived by dividing the time during which the member was engaged in his duties within the years, by the time he was required by his employment to be so engaged. \n(Amended by Ord. 299-64, App. 11/9/64)\n\nSEC. 16.37-8.  EXCESS RETIREMENT BENEFITS.\n     (a)     Whenever any person has been paid retirement benefits in excess of that which he was entitled to receive, by reason of excess earnings in gainful occupation after retirement, such person, upon demand of the Retirement Board, shall pay back into the Retirement Fund such excess. \n     (b)     The full amount of such retirement benefits paid in excess of that which such person was entitled to receive shall be repaid to the Retirement Fund in one sum immediately upon demand, provided that the Retirement Board may permit the repayment to be made in installments where it finds that repayment in one sum immediately would cause undue hardship on such person. \n     (c)     Funds received as repayment of such excess shall be returned to the account from which the excess was paid.\n     (d)     The Retirement Board may authorize and direct the withholding of any and all benefit payments to such person until the full amount of such excess has been repaid. Where benefit payments are not withheld, while installment repayments are permitted by the Retirement Board, should the person fail or neglect to promptly pay any installment when due the Retirement Board at its discretion may forthwith authorize or direct the withholding of any and all further benefit payments to such person until repayment is made of the full amount of the excess or the full amount of the unpaid installments. \n     (e)     The City Attorney is hereby authorized and directed to take such action against such person, upon request of the Retirement Board, as may be necessary to effect full recovery of any such excess. \n(Added by Ord. 96-63, App. 5/2/63)\n\nSEC. 16.37-9.  POWER TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS.\n     The Retirement Board shall have the power and authority to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, testimony and other evidence before it by subpoena in connection with any inquiry, matter, proceeding or hearing by or before the Board. \n     The subpoenas herein provided for shall be issued in the name of the Retirement Board by the Secretary of the Retirement Board, or, in his absence, by the acting Secretary. \n     Any person refusing to obey such subpoena or to produce such books, papers, testimony or other evidence shall be deemed in contempt and subject to proceedings and penalties as provided by general law in such instances. \n(Added by Ord. 292-62, App. 11/20/62)\n\nSEC. 16.38.  ESTIMATES BY BOARD OF LENGTH OF SERVICE, ETC.\n     If it shall be impracticable for the Retirement Board to determine from the records the length of service, the compensation or the age of any members, the Board may estimate, for the purposes hereof, such length of service, compensation or age. \n(Bill No. 1125, Ord.

In no event, however, shall a monthly payment on the redeposit be less than $20 and in no event shall the period for the making of installment payments extend beyond the effective date of retirement. Said election shall be made by written document filed in the office of the Retirement System prior to the effective date of retirement. \n     If a member shall not so elect, or having so elected subsequently does not make such redeposit, he shall re-enter as a new member without credit for any service, and his rate of contribution for future years shall be the normal rate provided by the Charter or this Code. \n     If a member elects to redeposit his accumulated normal contributions in accordance with this Section, his normal rate of contribution beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the date his election is filed in the office of the Retirement System shall be based on an age determined by adding the number of completed years of his absence from membership beginning with the earliest termination of his membership included in such redeposit, to the age upon which his normal rate of contribution, as it was prior to the termination, was based. His membership is the same as if it were unbroken by such termination. \n     If such member never failed to redeposit accumulated contributions withdrawn from the Retirement Fund; or, if he shall redeposit such accumulated contributions upon first re-entering hereafter, and not otherwise, then he shall receive credit for prior service in the same manner as persons who become members on January 8, 1932; provided, that members under Section \n8.565 of the Charter shall receive credit for such prior service even though having withdrawn no accumulated contributions they shall make no redeposit; in the event such redeposit is made by a person who is a member under Section \n8.507 of the Charter, an amount equal to the accumulated normal contributions so redeposited, except accumulated normal contributions for time on and after July 1, 1965, of members who exercise a valid election provided for in Section 16.70 of this Code, shall again be held for the benefit of the member and shall no longer be included in the amounts available to meet the obligations of the City and County on account of benefits that have been granted and on account of prior service of members. \n(Amended by Ord. 363-69, App. 12/23/69; Ord. 326-00, File No. 001921, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 16.48.  PAYMENTS AFTER RE-ENTRY INTO SYSTEM.\n     Notwithstanding provisions in this Code to the contrary, any member of the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System under Sections \n8.507 or \n8.509 of the Charter, who prior to January 1, 1953, elected upon one or more re-entries into the system after withdrawing his accumulated contributions from the Retirement Fund, not to redeposit such accumulated contributions, and who therefore re-entered the system as a new member without credit for any service and with a rate of contribution based on his age at such re-entry, may redeposit all of the withdrawn accumulated contributions not previously redeposited, in monthly payments, plus interest, at the respective interest rates used under the Retirement System from time to time since such re-entry, from the respective dates of re-entry to the date of payment; provided, that in no event shall any monthly payment on the redeposit, except the payment of the balance due, be less than three percent of the amount to be redeposited or 20 percent of the compensation earned during the month, whichever is the lesser. Any such member shall elect on or before the expiration of 180 days after the effective date of this Section to make or not to make such redeposit. Failure to elect shall be deemed an election not to redeposit. \n     If a member elects under this Section to make the redeposit and does not pay in full the amount due, the portion of the redeposit paid shall be refunded to him, and his status under the Retirement System shall be the same as if he had never elected under this Section to make such redeposit. The accumulated contributions standing to the credit of such member on the effective date of this Section and his rate of contribution shall not be affected by this Section. \n     If a member redeposits under this Section, his membership shall be the same as if he had redeposited at the time he first had the right to do so. If such redeposit is made by a member under Section \n8.507 of the Charter, an amount equal to the accumulated normal contributions so deposited shall again be held for the benefit of the member and shall no longer be included in the amounts available to meet the obligations of the City and County on account of benefits that have been granted and on account of prior service of members. The contributions required of the City and County currently, as percentages of salaries of persons who are members under Section \n8.509 of the Charter, shall be increased to percentages determined by the actuary as necessary to increase the reserve held by the Retirement System on account of miscellaneous members by an amount equal to the increase in liabilities under the system resulting from redeposits under this Section, by members under Sections 8.07 and \n8.509 of the Charter. \n(Ord.

The head of such office or department or the Controller shall apply such rate of contribution to all of his compensation to determine the amount to be contributed by each member, and shall furnish immediately to the Retirement Board a copy of each and every such payroll. \n     Each of such amounts shall be deducted by the Controller and shall be deposited by the Retirement Board in the Retirement Fund and shall be credited by the Retirement Board, together with regular interest, to the individual account of the member for whom the contribution was made. The Retirement Board, however, may accept cash payments by any member of amounts necessary to correct or adjust the contribution account of such member, the amount so accepted to be deposited and credited in the same manner as if deducted on a payroll and the Controller to be notified of such payment. \n     Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the contribution made and provided for by this Article, and shall receipt in full for his salary or compensation, and payment less such contribution shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except his claims to the benefits to which he may be entitled under the provisions of this Article. \n(Amended by Ord. 65-65, App. 3/19/65; Ord. 326-00, File No. 001921, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 16.55.  ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\n     Any member, except persons who are members under Sections \n8.540 and \n8.565 of the Charter, may elect to contribute at rates in excess of those provided in this Article for the purpose of providing additional benefits, but the exercise of this privilege by a member shall not place on the City and County any additional financial obligation.

No. 4073(C.S.), Sec. 36)\n\nSEC. 16.55-1.  DEFINITION OF \"PUBLIC SERVICE.\"\n     As used in Sections \n16.55-1 to \n16.55-4, inclusive, \"public service\" means: \n     (a)     Civilian service rendered as an employee or officer of an agency of the government of the United States;\n     (b)     Civilian service rendered as an employee or officer of the State of California; and\n     (c)     Service rendered as an employee or officer of a public agency in the State of California which, with respect to such service, maintained a locally administered defined benefit plan or was entitled to participate in the Public Employees' Retirement System of the State of California under a contract between such public agency and the Public Employees' Retirement System. \n     For the purposes of this Section, a person shall be considered as being in public service only while he or she was receiving compensation from the public agency of which he or she was an employee or officer. \n     \"Public service,\" as used herein, does not include service as defined in Subdivisions (a), (b) or (c) of this Section with respect to which a person became a member of any other retirement system supported wholly or in part by public funds and with respect to which he or she continues to receive credit in such other system or with respect to which he or she is entitled to receive a retirement allowance under such other system. \n(Added by Ord. 171-70, App. 5/28/70; amended by Ord. 308-08, File No. 080379, App. 12/16/2008)\n\nSEC. 16.55-2.  ELECTION TO CONTRIBUTE AND RECEIVE CREDIT FOR PUBLIC SERVICE.\n     Any member of the Retirement System under Sections \nA8.509, \nA8.584 or \nA8.587 of the Charter who was in public service prior to becoming a member of this Retirement System shall have the right to elect to make contributions pursuant to Section \n16.55-3 of this Code and to receive credit in this system as miscellaneous City and County service for all or any part of the time he or she was in such public service; provided, that a member so electing must elect to receive credit for no less than six months of such public service or all of his or her public service where the total period of his or her public service is less than six months. \n     Said election shall be made in writing on a form provided by the Retirement System. Said election may be made at any time before the date he or she files the application to retire or the effective date of his or her retirement, whichever is later. \n     The time period and amount of public service for which a member elects to contribute and the fact that he or she is not entitled to receive credit in another retirement system by virtue of such service must be certified to by an officer of the public agency to which he or she rendered such public service and by an officer of the retirement system of which he or she was a member with respect to such service, or must otherwise be established to the satisfaction of the Retirement Board.\n(Added by Ord. 171-70, App. 5/28/70; amended by Ord. 308-08, File No. 080379, App. 12/16/2008)\n\nSEC. 16.55-3.  CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVICE CREDIT.\n     Any member of the Retirement System under Sections \nA8.509, \nA8.584 and \nA8.587 of the Charter, who elects, pursuant to Section \n16.55-2 to make contributions and receive credit as miscellaneous City and County service for all or any part of the time he or she was in public service, shall contribute to the Retirement Fund an amount equal to the product of: \n     (a)     the monthly compensation earnable by said member on the date he or she makes a lump sum payment to purchase the prior public service credit or delivers to the Retirement System a signed installment payment agreement to purchase the prior public service credit, multiplied by \n     (b)     the normal cost percentage of the applicable miscellaneous plan as published in the most recent actuarial valuation adopted by the Retirement Board, multiplied by \n     (c)     the number of months of prior public service being purchased.\n     (d)     In addition, members who make payment by other than lump sum payment shall pay interest on the unpaid balance of the amount payable into the Retirement Fund under this Section, commencing on the date of the member's election to make such contributions, at the rate of interest currently being used from time to time under the Retirement System. \n     Payment of the contributions required by this Section shall be made in a lump sum or by installment payments. Installment payments shall be made at times and in a manner fixed by the Retirement Board; provided, that the period for completion of such payments shall not exceed five years. All payments required by this Section must be received by the Retirement System before the date the member files the application to retire or the effective date of the member's retirement, whichever is later. \n     Any member who elects to purchase credit for prior public service by installment payments may, at any time during the period for making such installment payments, complete the purchase by lump sum payment. \n     Except as prohibited by the Internal Revenue Service, any member who elects to purchase credit for prior public service by installment payments may, at any time prior to completion of payment for such purchase, revoke his or her election. Such revocation shall be in writing and shall be effective only if filed with the Retirement System. Upon such revocation of election, the member shall have the option to receive a refund of all of the contributions which he or she has made pursuant to such election or to receive credit for the prior public service purchased up to the date of the revocation. If said member elects to receive a refund, then he or she shall thereafter not have the right to elect to receive credit for the public service which was the subject of said revoked election. \n     All contributions made pursuant to this Section, and the interest thereon shall be considered to be and shall be administered as contributions of the member; provided that only the share of said contributions representing the member's contributions, including interest, shall he considered when calculating benefits payable pursuant to Sections \nA8.509(f), \nA8.584-6 and \nA8.587-6 of the Charter. \n(Added by Ord. 171-70, App. 5/28/70; amended by Ord. 308-08, File No. 080379, App. 12/16/2008)\n\nSEC. 16.55-4.  CREDIT IN RETIREMENT SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC SERVICE.\n     Upon completion of payment of contributions in the amount specified in Section \n16.55-3, the member shall be credited with miscellaneous City and County service in the amount of public service for which he or she has elected to receive credit as miscellaneous City and County service pursuant to Section \n16.55-2. The miscellaneous City and County service with which the member is so credited shall be credited as current service. \n(Added by Ord. 171-70, App. 5/28/70; amended by Ord. 308-08, File No. 080379, App. 12/16/2008)\n\nSEC. 16.55-5.  RULES AND REGULATIONS.\n     The Retirement Board shall adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions of Section \n16.55-1 through \n16.55-4, inclusive, of this Code. \n(Added by Ord. 171-70, App. 5/28/70)\n\nSEC. 16.55-6.  RECIPROCAL BENEFITS.\n     This Section shall extend the following rights in the Retirement System to members of any other public agency retirement system (hereinafter \"reciprocal system\") which adopts similar reciprocal provisions in their retirement ordinances or plans pursuant to Sections 20042, 20043, 31840.2 and 45310.5 of the Government Code, and who by contract agree to extend the benefits thereof to the Retirement System; provided that such member enters employment and becomes a member under the Retirement System of the reciprocal system within six months of terminating his or her employment under such other reciprocal system or the Retirement System. \n     (a)     Notwithstanding any provisions of the Retirement System or a reciprocal system plan in the matter of vesting, any member subject to Charter Sections \n8.509, \n8.559, \n8.584, \n8.585, \n8.586 and \n8.588 whose movement between systems occurs as herein specified shall have the right to elect to leave his or her accumulated contributions on deposit irrespective of the amount of such contributions or length of service. Interest on said accumulated contributions shall accrue at plan rates. If a member does not vest or qualify for a reciprocal benefit the member shall receive a refund of contributions plus interest. \n     (b)     The average monthly salary during any period of service as a member of a reciprocal system shall be considered compensation earned or earnable by a member of the Retirement System for purposes of computing final average compensation for such member according to the applicable Charter provisions, provided the member retires concurrently under both systems and is credited with such period of service under one reciprocal system at the time of retirement. \n     (c)     For the sole purpose of meeting minimum service qualifications for benefits and retirement allowances under the Retirement System, service shall also include service rendered as an officer or employee of a reciprocal system if the salary for such service constitutes compensation earned or earnable by a member of this system. For police and fire members of the Retirement System subject to Charter Sections \n8.559, \n8.585, \n8.586 and \n8.588, if Retirement System service is less than 25 years at the time of retirement, the member shall receive a pro rata portion of the benefit for 25 years of service. \n     Police and fire members of the Retirement System subject to Charter Sections \n8.559, \n8.585, \n8.586 and \n8.588, with 25 or more years of service credit with the Retirement System, shall receive benefits based on Retirement System service only as defined by Charter Sections \n8.559, \n8.585, \n8.586 and \n8.588. \n     (d)     Any retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of a police or fire member of the Retirement System subject to Charter Sections \n8.559 and \n8.585 shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Charter Sections \n8.559-6 and \n8.585-6, provided that any increase or decrease shall be related to the rank or position that said member held for at least one year immediately prior to terminating City service and provided further that if the member's accrued service credit is less than 25 years, the Charter Section \n8.559-6 and \n8.585-6 adjustments will be multiplied by a fraction where the denominator is 25 and the numerator is equal to the member's accrued service credit at the date of termination of City service. \n     (e)     A member shall be retired for disability and receive a retirement allowance based on the service credited to him or her at the time of retirement during any period in which he or she receives a disability retirement allowance under a reciprocal system; provided, that such allowance shall not exceed an amount which when added to the allowance paid under the reciprocal system equals the allowance which would be paid for a non-service connected disability if all the member's service had been credited under the reciprocal system; and provided further, that such allowance shall in no event be less than an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the member's contributions, whether or not the disability is for service connected reasons. The minimum allowance provisions of the City Charter will not be applied if the member has less than 10 years of credited service under the Retirement System. In such a case, the disability allowance paid by the Retirement System shall be based on San Francisco service only. \n     (f)     The death benefit for a member who dies from non-industrial causes as a member of a reciprocal system shall not exceed an amount which when added to the death benefit paid for such member under the reciprocal system equals the death benefit payable under that system had all reciprocal service been rendered under that system; provided, however, that such death benefit shall be at least the amount of the member's accumulated contributions in the Retirement System. If death is caused by industrial injury or disease in the reciprocal system, the death benefit shall be the amount of the member's accumulated contributions in the Retirement System. For a member of the Retirement System who dies from non-industrial causes, the minimum allowance provisions will not be applied if the member needs service rendered in a reciprocal system to meet mini-mum service qualification for a survivor allowance. In such a case, the allowance paid by the Retirement System shall be based on San Francisco service only. \n     (g)     The Retirement Board shall on the request of a reciprocal system supply information and data necessary for administration of such system as it is affected by membership in and service credited under the Retirement System. \n     (h)     Interpretation of this Section shall be made consistent with the City Charter and with reference to interpretations that have been made relative to the reciprocal benefit provisions of the Public Employees' Retirement System and 1937 County Employees' Retirement Act upon which this Section is based and which this Section is intended to implement. This Section shall not apply to members who transfer solely within the Retirement System between miscellaneous, police and fire plans. \n     (i)     These provisions shall apply only to a member whose termination and entry into employment resulting in a change in membership from the Retirement System to such other reciprocal system or from such other reciprocal system to the Retirement System occurred after such acceptance by the Board of Supervisors or after the effective date specified in the agreement; provided, however, that provisions relating to computation of final compensation shall apply to any other member if such provision would have applied had the termination and entry into employment occurred after such acceptance or determination by a system's governing board. \n     (j)     Reciprocal rights under this Section shall be modified as necessary to conform to amendments to the Public Employees' Retirement Law or the County Employees' Retirement Law of 1937 as provided in Government Code Section 20042. \n(Added by Ord. 275-88, App. 6/29/88; amended by Ord. 371-90, App. 11/13/90)\n\nSEC. 16.55-7.  INTERNAL RECIPROCITY OF PENSION BENEFITS WITHIN THE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.\n     (a)     When Internal Reciprocity Applies. Subject to the provisions of Charter Section \n8.500-1, including but not limited to the effective dates therein, when a person ceases to be a member of the Retirement System under Charter Section \n8.509, \n8.559, \n8.584, \n8.585, \n8.586 or \n8.588, or is granted a leave of absence to work in another city position, and then within six months, again becomes a member of the Retirement System under a different set of Charter provisions, this section shall allow such member to receive reciprocal benefits within the Retirement System if the member retires concurrently under all benefit provisions. \n     (b)     Summary of Internal Reciprocity. Reciprocal benefits within the Retirement System shall mean that: (1) all service credit earned within the Retirement System shall be used for qualification purposes, (2) final compensation shall include compensation earned while a member under any set of Charter provisions and (3) pension benefit calculations shall be prorated based on service credit earned and determined according to the provisions and percentages specified under each set of Charter sections. \n     (c)     Procedures. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Retirement System concerning vesting, on and after April 1, 1993, any member whose movement between different sets of Charter provisions occurs as specified in Paragraph (a), shall have the right to elect on the form specified by the Retirement System to leave his or her accumulated contributions on deposit irrespective of the amount of such contributions or the length of service. Interest on said accumulated contributions shall continue to accrue at plan rates. If the member does not qualify for reciprocal benefits or vest, the member shall receive a refund of contributions plus interest. \n          Members of the retirement system on and after April 1, 1993, who received refunds of pension contributions prior to April 1, 1993 for periods of membership that would otherwise qualify for reciprocity benefits within the Retirement System, may redeposit those contributions plus interest at plan rates at any time before death or retirement, whichever occurs first, and qualify for reciprocity within the Retirement System. \n          Members of the Retirement System on and after April 1, 1993, who had periods of City employment prior to becoming members of the Retirement System that would otherwise qualify for reciprocity benefits within the Retirement System, may receive service credit by paying member contributions plus interest at plan rates based on the compensation received during those periods of employment at any time before death or retirement, whichever occurs first, and qualify for reciprocity within the Retirement System. \n     (d)     Final Compensation. Average final compensation shall be based on all compensation earned or earnable by a member during any period of membership under the Retirement System, provided that the member is credited with such period of service at the time of retirement and provided further that pension benefit calculations shall be prorated based on service credit earned and determined according to the provisions, including, but not limited to the final compensation provisions, and percentages specified under each set of Charter provisions. \n     (e)     Qualification Purposes. For the sole purpose of meeting minimum service qualifications for benefits and retirement allowances under the Retirement System, service shall include any service credit earned under the Charter provisions of the Retirement System as described in Paragraph (a) above. \n          For police and fire members of the Retirement System, if service credit as defined by Charter Sections \n8.559-10, \n8.585-10, \n8.586-10 and \n8.588-10 is less than 25 years at the time of retirement, the member shall receive a pro rata portion of the benefit for 25 years of service. Police and fire members of the Retirement System with 25 or more years of service credit with the Retirement System, shall receive police and fire benefits based only on the portion of Retirement System service credit defined by Charter Sections \n8.559-10, \n8.585-10, \n8.586-10 and \n8.588-10; they shall receive miscellaneous retirement benefits based only on the portion of Retirement System service credit earned under Charter Sections \n8.509 and \n8.584. \n     (f)     Cost-of-Living Adjustments. Cost-of-living adjustments for any retirement or death allowance shall be prorated based on the member's accrued service credit under Charter Sections \n8.509, \n8.559, \n8.584, \n8.585, \n8.586 or \n8.588. \n          Any retirement or death allowance payable to or on account of a police or fire member of the Retirement System subject to Charter Sections \n8.559 and \n8.585 shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Charter Section \n8.559-6 and \n8.585-6, provided that any increase or decrease shall be related to the rank or position that said member held for at least one year immediately prior to terminating police or fire service and provided further that if the member's accrued service credit under Charter Section \n8.559-10 or \n8.585-10 is less than 25 years, the Charter Section \n8.559-6 and \n8.585-6 adjustments will be multiplied by a fraction where the denominator is 25 and the numerator is equal to the member's accrued service credit under Charter Section \n8.559-10 or \n8.585-10. \n     (g)     Disability Benefits. When a member is retired for disability, he or she shall receive a disability retirement allowance based on all service credit earned in the retirement system provided that the disability allowance allowed under any earlier set of Charter provisions shall not exceed an amount which when added to the allowance provided under the current set of Charter provisions equals the allowance which would be paid for a nonservice connected disability if all the member's service had been credited under the set of Charter provisions in which the member was last active prior to the effective date of his or her disability retirement. If a member is retired for a service connected disability under Charter Sections \n8.559, \n8.585, \n8.586 or \n8.588, then he or she will be entitled to an additional refund or vesting benefit under the provisions of Charter Sections \n8.509 or \n8.584. \n     (h)     Death Benefits. If an active member, under Charter Sections \n8.559, \n8.585, \n8.586 or \n8.588, dies by reason of an industrial injury or illness, then the death benefit may include the refund of the member's accumulated contributions in the Retirement System relating to service credit under Charter Sections \n8.509 and \n8.584. In all other death cases, the death benefit shall not exceed an amount which equals the death benefit payable had all reciprocal service been rendered under the plan in which the member was active immediately before the time he or she died. \n     (i)     Interpretation Consistent With PERS. Interpretation of this section shall be made consistent with the Charter Section \n8.500-1 and with reference to interpretations that have been made relative to the reciprocal benefit provisions of the Public Employees' Retirement System and The 1937 County Employees' Retirement Act. This section shall apply to members who transfer solely within the Retirement System as described in Paragraph (a) above. \n     (j)     Concurrent Accrual of Benefits Prohibited. With the exception of adult hourly credits, members shall not accrue pension benefits concurrently under Charter Section \n8.509, \n8.559, \n8.584, \n8.585, \n8.586 or \n8.588. For internal reciprocity purposes, a person shall be deemed to be an active member under only the set of Charter provisions as determined by his or her pension contributions at the time of any particular pension event. \n(Added by Ord. 231-93, App. 7/22/93)\n\nSEC. 16.56.  WITHDRAWAL OF ACCUMULATED ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE PURSUANT TO SECTION \n16.55-5.\n     Any person who is a member of the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System and has made additional contributions pursuant to Administrative Code Section \n16.55 shall have the right to elect, in writing on a form furnished by the system and to be filed at the office of said system, to withdraw forthwith all or any part of his accumulated additional contributions and to receive repayment in a lump sum; provided, however, that the right of withdrawal of said funds shall be limited to not more than three in number during said employee's tenure of employment in the City and County service and membership in the Retirement System. \n(Amended by Ord. 226-66, App. 9/1/66)\n\nSEC. 16.61-1.  IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 414(h)(2).\n     (a)     The purpose of this section is to implement the provisions contained in Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States concerning the tax treatment of employee contributions paid by the City and County on behalf of affected employees and to adopt the limitations set forth in Sections 401(a) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n          Pursuant to Section 414(h)(2) contributions to a pension plan, although designated under the plan as employee contributions, when paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the employee, under circumstances in which the employee does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of having them paid by the employer, may be excluded from the gross income of the employee until these amounts are distributed or made available to the employee. \n     (b)     Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the City and County may pick up, for the sole and limited purpose of deferring taxes as authorized by Section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A. 414(h)(2)] and Section 17501 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, all or a portion of the contributions required to be paid by a member of the Retirement System. Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that any contributions so picked up by the City are to be treated as City contributions for any purpose other than the sole and limited purpose specified herein. No pickup shall be made pursuant to this section except upon a determination by the Controller as required by subsection (e) below. \n          The provisions of this Section shall be administered on a bargaining unit basis and shall be subject to any applicable meet and confer laws. \n          Any appropriate representation unit recognized by the City and County, by and through the employee organization certified to represent it, may opt out of the provisions of this Section by meeting and conferring with the City and County's Employee Relations Division for a memorandum of understanding to so provide. In the event such agreement is reached, contributions of the employees involved shall be treated for all purposes in the same manner and to the same extent as members' contributions made prior to the operative date of this Section. \n          A memorandum of understanding arrived at under this subsection shall continue in effect from year to year, subject to termination by notice by the employee organization which had negotiated the memorandum of understanding, served not less than ninety days prior to the proposed date of termination. \n     (c)     No member shall have the option of choosing to receive directly the contributions picked up by the City and County instead of having such amounts paid to the Retirement System. \n     (d)     The contributions picked up by the City and County shall be treated for all purposes, other than taxation, in the same manner and to the same extent as members' contributions made prior to the operative date of this section. \n     (e)     This section shall be operative only so long as the City and County's pickup of employee contributions continues to be excludable from the gross income of members under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(h)(2). \n          The City and County shall retain the authority periodically to increase, reduce or eliminate, subject to meet and confer where legally appropriate, the pickup by the City and County of all or a portion of the contributions required to be paid by a member of the Retirement System, as authorized by Section 414(h)(2), Internal Revenue Code. \n     (f)     The employer pickup shall work as follows:\n          1.     General RulePickup. All employee contributions required under the Retirement System for amounts earned on and after an effective date to be specified by the Controller (\"the Effective Date\") shall be paid by the respective member's employer in lieu of contributions by the member. The member shall have no right to alter the amount of such contribution, nor shall the member have the right to receive directly the contributed amounts instead of having the employer pay them to the Retirement System. \n          2.     ExceptionPickup.\n               a.     Employer Contribution. A member may elect as specified below to have his or her employer contribute in lieu of the employee's contribution, the amount of the reduced rate of contributions specified in Charter Section \n8.514(a), effective for amounts earned on and after the Effective Date. The member shall have no right to alter the amount of such employer contribution on his or her behalf, nor shall the member have the right to receive directly the contributed amounts instead of having the employer pay them to the Retirement System. \n               b.     Right of Further Employee Contribution. The member shall continue to have the right to make further contributions as specified in Charter Section \n8.514(a) so that the total contributed on his or her behalf by (i) the member's employer and (ii) the member equals the total employee contribution otherwise required under the Retirement System. \n               c.     Timely Election of Reduced Pickup. In order to qualify for the reduced pickup, the member must complete the Retirement System's form electing the reduced pickup and then timely file such form with the Retirement System. \n                    (i)     The Controller shall specify an election period which shall begin on an Election Date and end on a Cutoff Date. The Cutoff Date shall be prior to the Effective Date. For members who are earning compensation subject to Retirement System contributions on the Election Date, the election form must be filed with the Retirement System no later than the Cutoff Date. The election shall become effective for earnings on and after the Effective Date. \n                    (ii)     For members who are not earning compensation subject to Retirement System contributions on the Election Date, but who do so at some time after that date, the election form must be filed with the Retirement System on the first day after the Election Date that the member earns such compensation. The election shall become effective for earnings on and after the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the date that the employee files the election with the Retirement System. \n          3.     Irrevocability.\n               a.     Members Electing Full Pickup. All members who did not timely file the election specifying the reduced pickup shall have the further contribution picked up and shall have no further opportunity to elect the reduced pickup. \n               b.     Members Electing Reduced Pickup. All members who timely filed the election specifying the reduced pickup shall have only the reduced rate contribution picked up and shall have no further opportunity to elect the full pickup. \n          4.     Exception: Employees Covered by Certain Memoranda of Understanding.\n               a.     Coverage Under a Memorandum of Understanding Specifying Pickup Treatment. If a duly certified bargaining unit enters into a memorandum of understanding with the employer that specifies that employees covered by the memorandum of understanding who are members of the Retirement System will have (i) the full pickup, or (ii) no pickup, then all members so covered shall be treated as described in that memorandum of understanding for as long as they are covered by it. \n               b.     Cessation of Coverage Under a Memorandum of Understanding Specifying Pickup Treatment. If a member ceases to be covered by a memorandum of understanding with the employer specifying how covered employees will be treated with respect to the pickup, then: \n                    (i)     If the member had not previously had the opportunity to elect the reduced pickup, the member shall be offered such election on the first day on which the member earns compensation subject to Retirement System contributions following cessation of coverage under the memorandum of understanding. \n                    (ii)     If the member previously had the opportunity to choose the reduced pickup, then the member's pickup shall again be treated as it was prior to coverage under the memorandum of understanding. \n          5.     Employees Not Covered by Social Security. The Controller may specify different Effective Dates for employees covered by Social Security and for employees not covered by Social Security.

Said values shall be determined by the actuary, who shall take into account the interest which shall be earned on said contributions, the compensation experience of members, and the probabilities of separation from service by all causes of members before retirement, and death of members after retirement. Said percentage shall be changed only on the basis of said periodical actuarial valuation and investigation into the experience under the system. \n     The benefits provided in this Section, however, shall not be applicable to any member who is not continuously in the status of a retired person for time beginning on a date not later than the first day of the month next following his attainment of the age of 70 years during the period ending June 30, 1966; the age of 69 years during the 12 months ending June 30, 1967; the age of 68 years during the 12 months ending June 30, 1968; the age of 67 years during the 12 months ending June 30, 1969; the age of 66 years during the 12 months ending June 30, 1970; and thereafter following the attainment of the age of 65 years; but, instead, such person shall be entitled to the benefits otherwise provided for members under Charter Section \n8.507 by the provisions of this Code for persons who do not exercise the election provided in Paragraph (a) of this Section, in the same manner as though he had never made such election, and if he has contributed to the Retirement System pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the system shall be adjusted by refund to him or payment by him to bring the account to the amount which would have been credited to it had the member never made such election and had not contributed in the manner prescribed by it. \n     For the purposes of this Section the phrase \"status of a retired person\" shall mean with respect to any person a status beginning on the effective date of a retirement allowance which the person is entitled to receive as a result of his valid application for such allowance, which was filed in the office of the system not later than the last day of the month in which such allowance becomes effective. \n     It is hereby declared to be the intent of this Section that the benefit provisions contained herein would not have been enacted without the conditions expressed herein requiring that to be eligible for such benefits, any member who positively exercises the election provided herein, must actually contribute as prescribed herein, and file an application for retirement within the time and in the manner provided herein, so as to place himself in the status of a retired person continuously for the time stipulated herein, in conformity with the provisions hereof, and in the absence of strict compliance with such provisions, that such election shall be void and of no effect, and that the member shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section; except that the accumulated contributions standing to his credit in the Retirement System shall be adjusted to what they would have been if he had not contributed in accordance with such election. \n(Added by Ord. 65-65, App. 3/19/65; amended by Ord. 326-00, File No. 001921, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 16.70-3.  RETIREMENT AFTER 3/31/66 UNDER PARAGRAPH (b) OF SECTION 16.70-1.\n     The service retirement allowance of any member who retires for service effective on or after March 31, 1966, as a member entitled to a service retirement allowance calculated according to the provisions of Paragraph (b) of Section \n16.70-1 of this Code shall be a service retirement allowance at the rate of 1 percent of the average monthly compensation earned by him during any three consecutive years of credited service in the Retirement System in which such average is the highest for each year of service credited to him in the Retirement System, and such allowance shall be in lieu of the service retirement allowance to which he would be entitled under the provisions of said Paragraph (b) of Section \n16.70-1. \n     This Section is not applicable to any person whose retirement allowance was first effective prior to March 31, 1966.

Upon the basis of such examination, the Board shall determine whether the disability beneficiary is still incapacitated, physically or mentally, for service in the office or department of the City and County where he was employed and in the position held by him when retired for disability. If the Retirement Board shall determine that the beneficiary is not so incapacitated, his retirement allowance shall be cancelled forthwith, and he shall be reinstated to the position of the same class as that held by him when retired for disability. \n     (b)     Should a beneficiary after retirement for disability re-enter the City and County service and be eligible for membership in the Retirement System, his retirement allowance shall be cancelled and he shall immediately become a member of the Retirement System. His individual account shall be credited with an amount which shall be the actuarial equivalent, at the time of such re-entry, based on a disabled life, of the annuity which would have been purchased by his accumulated contributions at the time he or she retired. Such amount shall not exceed the City and County accumulated contribution held for his benefit on account of service as a member, at the time of his retirement. Such member shall also receive credit for prior service in the same manner as it was at the time of his retirement. \n     (c)     Should any retired person, except persons retired for service prior to January 8, 1932, and persons retired because of disability incurred in the performance of duty, engaged in a gainful occupation, prior to attaining age 62, the Retirement Board shall reduce the amount of his monthly pension as defined in this Article to an amount which, when added to the compensation earned monthly by him in such occupation, shall not exceed the amount of the compensation on the basis of which his retirement allowance was determined. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, the Board may further alter his pension to an amount which shall not exceed its amount when he was originally retired, but which, subject to such limitation, shall equal, when added to the compensation earned by him the amount of his compensation on the basis of which his retirement allowance was determined. When the beneficiary reaches age 62, his retirement allowance shall be made equal to the amount upon which he was originally retired, and shall not again be modified for any cause. \n     (d)     Should any beneficiary retired for disability refuse, under age 62, to submit to a medical examination, his pension may be discontinued until his withdrawal of such refusal, and should such refusal continue for one year, his retirement allowance may be cancelled. \n(Bill No. 1125, Ord.

If he dies before he receives in lesser annuity payments the amount of his accumulated contributions as it was at his retirement, the balance of such accumulated contributions shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Retirement Board at the time of his election; or \n          Option 2. Upon his death, his lesser retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Retirement Board at the time of his election; or \n          Option 3. Upon his death, one-half of his lesser retirement allowance shall be continued throughout the life of and paid to such person as he shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the Retirement Board at the time of his election. \n     Said election of option shall be made by signing and filing with the Retirement Board a notarized election of option on a form provided by the Retirement Board; provided, however, that if a retired person shall die before the first payment on account of his retirement allowance is made, such election of option shall be considered void and of no effect and his death shall be considered as that of a member before retirement, unless: \n          (a)     Such retired person has elected Option 2 or 3; or\n          (b)     Such person was retired on or after April 1, 1966, as a member under Section \n8.507 or \n8.509 of the Charter and such person has elected Option 1 and an allowance as provided in Subsection (d) of Section \n16.80 of this Code is otherwise payable upon his death. \n(Amended by Ord. 296-83, App. 5/27/83)\n\nSEC. 16.75-1.  OPTIONAL MODIFICATION OF BENEFITS FOR FORMER SPOUSE.\n     (a)     If a domestic relations order requires a distribution to a former spouse after a member qualifies for retirement but before commencement of a member's pension, the retirement system may undertake such payments provided that such order conforms with the terms, conditions, and actuarial assumptions of the plan and provided further that the amount of any payments to be distributed to a former spouse plus interest shall be offset by either reductions in lump sum benefits or by an appropriate actuarial reduction of any allowance later payable to the member or a beneficiary. \n     (b)     At the time of retirement or later, a member, or a retired member, may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of his or her retirement allowance payable throughout his or her lifetime with the provision that: \n     During the member's lifetime, his or her lesser allowance shall be divided with a former spouse according to community property principles. Upon the member's death, the community property portion, not to exceed 50% of the reduced allowance, shall be payable to the former spouse throughout his or her lifetime. \n     The same portion of the normal cost-of-living adjustments that are payable to the former spouse during the member's lifetime will continue to be payable after the member's death. \n     A member may make this election after the first payment of a retirement allowance upon a determination that it is a bona fide and equitable division of the community property interest in the retirement allowance. \n     (c)     Nothing in this Section shall be construed to obligate the retirement system to pay greater benefits than those otherwise payable by the terms of the plan. Any allowance otherwise payable to any other survivor may be reduced by the benefits authorized under this Section to the degree necessary to ensure that the Retirement System does not pay increased benefits. \n(Added by Ord. 210-89, App. 6/22/89)\n\nSEC. 16.76.  METHOD OF PAYMENT OF ALLOWANCES.\n     A pension, an annuity, retirement allowance or death benefit allowance granted under the provisions of this Article shall be payable in equal monthly installments or in smaller pro-rata amounts when the pension, annuity, retirement allowance or death benefit allowance begins after the first day of the month or ends before the last day of the month; provided, that nothing in this Article shall prevent the payment at shorter intervals of benefits under the compensation, insurance and safety law of the state. \n(Bill No. 1125, Ord.

Upon the death of any person who is a member under Section \n8.540 or \n8.565 of the Charter, if such death shall result from his performance of duty as prescribed in such sections, respectively, or if such death in the case of members under Section \n8.565 of the Charter shall occur after qualification for service retirement, there shall be paid to the widow, children or parents of such member, the benefits provided in such sections, for members at January 8, 1932, of the Police and Fire Departments, upon death resulting from the performance of duty and upon death occurring after qualification for service retirement. If such death after qualification for service retirement shall not result from the performance of duty and if there be no surviving wife, children or parents to whom benefits are payable under this subsection, the benefits provided in the next following subsection shall be paid to the beneficiary nominated by him as prescribed therein. \n     (b)     Death Not in Performance of Duty. Upon the death before retirement, if such death be not included under Subsection (a) of this Section, of a member while in the city service, or within four months after the discontinuance of city service, or while physically or mentally incapacitated for performance of his duty, if such incapacity has been continuous from discontinuance of city service, the retirement system shall be liable for a death benefit, which, if an amount be due under Paragraph (3) of this subsection, and if there be a surviving wife or surviving children, shall be paid in monthly installments and to the surviving wife and children as prescribed therein; otherwise, such death benefit shall be paid to his estate, or to such person as he has nominated or shall nominate by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board, and such death benefit shall consist of: \n          (1)     His accumulated contributions, and in addition thereto.\n          (2)     An amount equal to the compensation earnable by him during the six months immediately preceding his death.\n          (3)     An amount sufficient, when added to the amounts provided in the next preceding Paragraphs (1) and (2), to provide, when applied according to mortality tables adopted by the board, a monthly death benefit equal to ½ of the monthly compensation earnable by such member during the 10 years immediately preceding his death, to be paid to the surviving wife to whom such member was married prior to sustaining the injury, to continue as long as she shall live or until her remarriage; or, if there be no widow, or if the widow die before any child of such deceased member shall have attained the age of 16 years, then to his child or children under such age collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains such age. If payment of the allowance be stopped because of remarriage of the widow or attainment of the age of 16 years by a child, before the sum of monthly payment made shall equal the sum of the amounts provided in the next preceding Paragraphs (1) and (2), then an amount equal to the difference between such sums shall be paid in one amount to the remarried widow; or, if there be no widow to the surviving children of the deceased member, to share and share alike. \n     (c)     Designation of Beneficiary. A member, or a beneficiary after the death of a member, may elect, by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board, to have the death benefit provided in this Section paid in monthly or annual installments instead of in one lump sum, subject to such rules and regulations as the board may adopt. \n     (d)     Death After Retirement. Upon the death of any person, except persons referred to in Sections \n8.542 and \n8.566 of the Charter, after retirement and while receiving a retirement allowance from the retirement system, there shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the Retirement Board, the sum of $100 for each completed year of city service credited to him at the time of his retirement, but the total amount paid shall not exceed $3,000; provided, that the sum so paid upon the death of a person who was receiving a retirement allowance under the San Francisco City and County Employees' Retirement System on January 8, 1932, or of a person who became a member of the retirement system by reason of his status as an employee of the public utility acquired by the City shall be not less than $500, regardless of the City service credited. If such deceased person was retired as a member under Sections \n8.507 or \n8.509 of the Charter and his retirement was first effective on or after April 1, 1966, an allowance shall be paid to his widow, until her death or remarriage, equal to ½ of his retirement allowance as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (A) of Charter Section \n8.514, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions. No allowance, however, shall be paid under this Section to a widow unless she was married to the member at least one year prior to the member's death. If he leaves no such widow, or if she should die or remarry before every child of such deceased retired person attains the age of 18 years, then the allowance which such widow would have received had she lived and not remarried shall be paid to his child or children under said age, collectively, to continue until every such child dies or attains said age, provided that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years. If the member, at retirement, has no wife who upon his death would qualify as a widow to receive the allowance provided in this subsection, he may elect an option, as provided under Section 16.75 of this Code, with respect to all of his allowance but if at his retirement he has such a wife, he may elect such option only with respect to that part of his retirement allowance, prior to reduction as provided in Charter Section \n8.514, which is in excess of the allowance which would be paid to his widow under this paragraph. The funds for payments under this paragraph shall be derived: \n          (1)     With respect to persons retired as members under Charter Sections \n8.509. \n8.544 and \n8.568 from reserves held by the retirement system on account of members under such sections, respectively, and \n          (2)     With respect to persons retired as members under Charter Sections \n8.507, \n8.543, and \n8.567 from the accumulated contributions of the City held to meet the obligation of the City on account of benefits that have been granted and on account of prior service of members. Upon the death of any person after retirement and while receiving a pension under Sections \n8.542 or \n8.566 of the Charter, as a retired member of the Police or Fire Department, there shall be paid to his estate or to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the retirement board, the sum of $3,000. The death benefits provided in this paragraph with respect to persons retired under Charter Sections \n8.542 or \n8.565, shall be funded by contributions to the retirement system by the City which shall not be less in any fiscal year than the amount of such benefits paid during said year. \n     (e)     Revocation of Nomination of Beneficiary. A person, while a member or after retirement, shall have the right to revoke the nomination of a beneficiary made by him under the retirement system, and to nominate a beneficiary in lieu thereof, all by written designation duly executed and filed with the Retirement Board; provided, that this right shall not extend to beneficiaries nominated under Options 2 and 3 of Section \n16.75 of this Code, nor shall it extend to dependents designated as beneficiaries by State law, the Charter or this Article, to receive benefits payable on account of death or disability incurred in the performance of duty. \n(Amended by Ord. 53-85, App. 2/2/84; Ord. 326-00, File No. 001921, App. 12/28/2000)\n\nSEC. 16.80-1.  DEATH AFTER RETIREMENT – PERSONS RETIRED PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 1966.\n     Upon the death on or after the effective date of this Section of a person who at the time of his death was receiving a retirement allowance as a person retired under Section 8.507 or 8.509 of the Charter and whose retirement allowance was first effective prior to April 1, 1966, an allowance shall be paid to his widow, until her death or remarriage, equal to ½ of his retirement allowance as it was prior to optional modification and prior to reduction as provided in Subsection (A) of Section 8.514 of the Charter, but exclusive of the part of such allowance which was provided by additional contributions.

provided, that no child shall receive any allowance after marrying or attaining the age of 18 years; it is provided however, that: \n     (a)     If on the effective date of this Section, such a retired person has a wife who upon his death would qualify as a widow to receive the allowance provided in this subsection;

Within 30 calendar days from the date of such notice, an employee organization with membership in the particular bargaining unit may file a challenging petition seeking to become the exclusive representative of said unit. The challenging statement shall contain verification, in the form of a signed petition, authorization cards, or union membership cards signed and dated by employees not more than six months prior to submission of 30 percent of the employees in the bargaining unit. Upon submission of such verification the challenging employee organization shall be placed on the ballot. \n     (c)     If a challenging petition has been filed, the Civil Service Commission Department shall, within 30 days after the period for filing a challenging petition expires or as soon thereafter as practicable, cause to be conducted a secret ballot election within the bargaining unit to determine which organization, if any, shall be recognized as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit. \n     (d)     If no challenging petition has been filed, and provided that the provisions of Government Code section 3507.1(c) are not applicable, the Civil Service Commission shall, within 30 days after the period for filing a challenging petition expires or as soon thereafter as is practicable, cause to be conducted a secret ballot election within the bargaining unit to determine which organization, if any, shall be recognized as the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit. \n     (e)     The ballot in any such election shall contain the choice of \"no organization.\" Where there are three or more choices and no one receives a majority of the valid ballots cast, a run-off election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of ballots cast. \n     (f)     Employees entitled to vote in a representation election shall be those employees within the bargaining unit with permanent status whose names appear on the last payroll bearing a date which is no less than 30 calendar days prior to the date on which the election is to be held or such other date within the discretion of the Civil Service Commission as may be practicable under the circumstances. \n     (g)     There shall be no more than one valid representation election in a 12 month period within the same bargaining unit.\n     (h)     As an alternative to the procedures outlined above, the provisions of MMBA, Government Code section 3507.1.(c) may be employed to the extent that the requirements of that section are met. The Civil Service Commission will certify an organization as the exclusive representative upon verification that all such requirements are met. A determination as to whether the requirements have been met shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Government Code section 3507.1(c). \n(Amended by Ord. 313-76, App. 7/30/76; Ord. 296-10, File No. 101157, App. 12/3/2010; Ord. 17-12, File No. 111067, App. 2/7/2012, Eff. 3/8/2012)\n\nSEC. 16.212.  DECERTIFICATION.\n     A decertification petition may be filed with the Civil Service Commission by employees or by an employee organization to determine whether or not the exclusive representative continues to represent a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. Such petition must be accompanied by proof of employee approval in the form of a signed petition, authorization cards, or union membership cards signed and dated by employees not more than six months prior to submission equal to at least 30 percent of the employees within the bargaining unit, and must be filed within the period between the 90th and 60th day immediately preceding the expiration date of the exclusive representative's existing memorandum of understanding, provided that the existing memorandum of understanding does not exceed a two year period. In the event the existing memorandum of understanding does exceed a two year period, the decertification petition may also be filed within the period between the 90th and 60th day immediately preceding the expiration of the second year of the memorandum of understanding. When such a petition has been filed, the Civil Service Commission shall cause to be conducted a secret ballot election to determine whether the incumbent exclusive representative shall be decertified and whether another organization shall be recognized. If the challenging employee organization receives a majority of the valid votes cast, the present exclusive representative will be decertified and the employee organization receiving a majority of the valid votes cast will become the exclusive representative. There shall be no more than one decertification election in a 12 month period, and no more than one decertification election during the first three years of the term of a memorandum of understanding, within the same bargaining unit. \n(Amended by Ord. 313-76, App. 7/30/76;

The City and County of San Francisco (City) finds that its own employees with same-sex spouses or same-sex domestic partners suffer both dignitary and economic harm as a result of discriminatory federal laws. In particular, as a result of discriminatory treatment under federal tax laws that impose taxes on health care coverage provided to employees with same-sex, but not those with opposite-sex, spouses, City employees with same-sex spouses or same-sex domestic partners suffer not only the indignities of being treated as second-class citizens by their own government; they also suffer measurable financial harm that is concrete, persistent, and significant, and in some cases immense.\n          The City is committed to the equitable principle that all City employees receive equal pay for equal work. That principle is unattainable for City employees with same-sex spouses or same-sex domestic partners so long as: (1) state law prevents same-sex couples from marrying; (2) federal law treats the value of employer contributions for same-sex spouses' or same-sex domestic partners' health insurance premiums as taxable income, and does not tax employer subsidies for opposite-sex spouses' health insurance premiums; and (3) federal law prevents the use of pre-tax dollars by employees to pay health insurance premiums for their same-sex spouses or same-sex domestic partners, while allowing the use of pre-tax dollars by employees to pay health insurance premiums for their opposite-sex spouses.\n          In an effort to offset the discriminatory impact of federal taxation on same-sex spouse and same sex-domestic partner health insurance premiums, and to come closer to achieving the equitable principle of equal pay for equal work, this Section \n16.704 requires the City to make payments to City employees who are provided subsidies for, and/or who pay all or part of the premiums for, their same-sex spouses' or same-sex domestic partners' health insurance premiums.\n     (b)     For each City employee Health Service System member who is subject to federal taxation on health insurance premiums (both medical and dental) paid by the City for a same-sex spouse, or same-sex domestic partner, the City shall pay an amount equal to twenty (20%) percent of the portion of the employee's health insurance premiums attributable to the same-sex spouse, or same-sex partner, as determined by the San Francisco Health Service System. These payments shall not be part of the employee's base pay, are not payments made as compensation for hours of employment, and shall not be included in any overtime or premium pay calculations.\n     (c)     Operative Date. This Section \n16.704 shall become operative on July 1, 2013.\n     (d)     Expiration. This Section \n16.704 shall expire in its entirety, or as applied specifically to one or more of the following three groups of City employees – employees with same-sex spouses who married in California; employees with same-sex spouses who married outside of California; and employees with same-sex domestic partners – if, and when, the City Attorney's Office certifies to the Mayor and the Board of Supervisors that one or more of those groups of City employees are no longer subject to discriminatory federal income taxation of health insurance premiums attributable to their same-sex spouses or same-sex domestic partners.
