{"text":"\n     The San Francisco Health Authority recognizes that Medi-Cal beneficiaries have traditionally faced a significant lack of access to health care and have been dependent upon traditional, safety net, and other concerned providers for needed health care services. The City and private providers of health care and other interested parties have collaborated in the development of a managed care plan and the San Francisco Health Authority is established as the result of this collaborative effort. \n     The Board of Supervisors has determined to establish the Health Authority as the Local Initiative under the Medi-Cal program. The Board of Supervisors has determined that it is in the public interest to establish the Health Authority to create an efficient, integrated health care delivery system in order to provide, as contracted by the California State Department of Health Services with the Authority, access to comprehensive health care services for Medi-Cal beneficiaries and such other persons as the Health Authority deems appropriate; to provide quality care that is compassionate, respectful and culturally and linguistically appropriate; and to ensure preservation of the safety net. \n(Added by Ord. 408-94, App. 12/15/94)\n\n","heading":{"title":"69","chaptersection":"2","identifier":"69.2","catch_text":"PURPOSE."}}
